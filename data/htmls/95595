                <dd>1) 2 stapled carbon-copy pages of a letter from Wilmarth to Oscar Kolin thanking him for his donation of Street Leaf #3 to the Whitney Museum's permanent collection. Dated March 16, 1978.<br />
<br />
2) Sheet of browned legal pad paper on which is written in blue ball-point a letter from Stan Cohen to Wilmarth. As becomes clear in later letters in this file, Cohen is a post-doc fellow in pediatric medicine at Harvard who owns one of Wilmarth's drawings and appears to follow his work. Here he asks if Wilmarth has any small sculptures in the $1000 range for sale and to please call him, as he is in New York for a couple of days. Undated, but presumably April of 1978, given the upcoming letters. On verso, Wilmarth has scrawled in black ink "metaphors" and "Rauschenberg."<br />
<br />
3) A double-sided handwritten letter in blue ball-point on legal paper, this time a more urgent missive from Stan Cohen, clearly written after a visit made to Wilmarth's studio only to find Wilmarth absent. Cohen explains his financial situation in more detail and presses Wilmarth to be in touch with him soon. Written on the same short trip to New York as the above. Dated 27 April 1978.<br />
<br />
4) Typed note on white paper from Bruce Owen, presumably a San Francisco collector, asking after the status of Blue Long Tango. Dated May 1, 1978. On verso Wilmarth has sketched or doodled in blue ink--what appears to be a frame drawn around a "#3" with the number 6 below it and an unintelligible scribble/number above it.<br />
<br />
5) Double-sided handwritten letter in black ball-point on white paper from Stan Cohen. Cohen thanks Wilmarth for his card and call and again expresses interest in soon owning a sculpture. He also proposes to buy more than 1 piece in order to sell the others to interested friends (he would sell them at a profit to these clients of his, then be able to use that profit to pay more to Wilmarth for his own piece; this appears to be something he has done before). Cohen writes this time from his home in Newton, Massachusetts. Dated 18 May, presumably 1978.<br />
<br />
6) Carbon copy of a handwritten note to Stan Cohen from Wilmarth. It seems to be in response to the above letter (item 5), though it references a line from an earlier one (item 3). Wilmarth's words are brusque. He expresses no desire to meet or work with Cohen in the future: "My, my, a pediatrician, collector, art dealer with a cry poor come-on. Your just a slightly different mix of the same old greedy bullshit. . . ." Wilmarth's address is stamped in the upper left corner, but the note is undated. I assume it was triggered by Cohen's letter of 18 May 1978. For another strange but conciliatory letter from Cohen, sent in February of the following year, see the "Emmerich War" file (CW2001.1672).<br />
<br />
7) Handwritten letter in black ball-point on red and white stationery from Marlene Baumgarten, indicating extreme excitement over Wilmarth's work after a visit with him in New York. She says she has shown his photographs to her husband who is also interested. In original envelope. Dated May 23, 1978.<br />
<br />
8) 2 one-sided pages of typed letter from Larry Meeker of Kansas City, Kansas, introducing himself to Wilmarth and showing great interest in owning a wall piece. He hopes to somehow work a trade of a set of Jasper Johns's "1st etchings, 1st state." Dated October 2, 1978.<br />
<br />
9) Clipped together by a small, gold circular spiral are the following: 2 pages of a letter in black ball-point on small white stationery with original envelope from Bubbles Zacharias and her husband Dick, anxious to work<br />
 quickly with Wilmarth to replace the glass of their Nine Clearings for a Standing Man #3, letter postmarked 9 October 1978; 2 separate typed letters from James Zacharias, presumably Dick's brother, who is helping the couple (perhaps there are financial or insurance troubles in replacing the glass?), writing on letterhead for Precision Plating Company, the letters dated October 24 and 31, 1978; and a xerox of a form from Navajo Freight Company, Inc., of New Jersey stating that they cannot reach Wilmarth in order to deliver the crated pieces of Nine Clearings #3 because his number is unlisted. All of the letters addressed directly to Wilmarth thank him for his warmth and understanding in the matter.<br />
<br />
10) Small postcard from Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., sent to Wilmarth because the company was unable to deliver a crate to him without his phone number (see item 9 above). Dated 10/19/1978.<br />
<br />
11) Small handwritten note on white stationery in original envelope from Charles and Rose Gibbs of Flemington, New Jersey, expressing their support during the Emmerich affair. Dated 10-12-1978. On back of envelope Wilmarth wrote in graphite the name and address of a David Dias.<br />
<br />
12) Carbon copy of a handwritten note from Wilmarth in response to Larry Meeker's request (item 8). Wilmarth writes that he currently has no wall pieces to sell through The Studio for the First Amendment, but that Daniel Weinberg, his California representative, does. He also says that Peder Bonnier [sp?] may be interested in the Johns prints. Dated October 12, 1978.<br />
<br />
13) Small stationery postcard with handwritten note in black ball-point from Jim Schramm of Burlington, Iowa, owner of Double Drawing. He thanks Wilmarth for a recent correspondence. Dated October 25, 1978.<br />
<br />
14) An identical typed letter from James Zacharias from October 31, 1978, as that found in item 9, as well as an identical xerox of the form from Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., also described in item 9 above. Curiously, both copies of Zacharias's letter are signed in blue felt-tip, so perhaps it was sent twice. The 2 sheets here are held  together by the same kind of gold spiral paperclip also as item 9; judging from the Precision Plating Company logo, I assume this fancy clip to be theirs. <br />
<br />
15) 2 one-sided pages of carbon copy of handwritten letter from Wilmarth to Bob [Dootson] sending along some black-and-white photographs to follow up on a discussion of possible works to replace a fountain currently in Dootson's yard. Bronze versions of Cornerskin and Days on Blue are mentioned. Dated April 23, 1979. In a letter in CW2001.1706 (item 1), Dootson has need to cancel the possible commission.<br />
<br />
16) Carbon copy of a handwritten note from Wilmarth to Patsy Nasher with costs and instructions to proceed with the repair of the glass for City Willows of 1976. He writes that the break is "a pressure type caused by improper tension in the wire cable." Dated May 15, 1979.<br />
<br />
17) Typed note on cream stationery from Agnes Saalfield of Concord, Massachusetts, confirming the successful installation of (and her pleasure with) New Ninth. Note is undated, but was sent to Wilmarth's Canal St. Station address and filed amid other correspondence from 1979.<br />
<br />
18) Note in blue ball-point on cream stationery card. From Deanna [last name?] thanking Wilmarth for her and her husband's new piece and sending a check for it. It seems that perhaps the work was  commissioned, as she writes "It was a pleasure working with you and Rena and Donald on this exciting project." Dated May 21, 1979.<br />
<br />
19) Typed letter on white stationery from Patsy Nasher of Dallas thanking Wilmarth for his above correspondence (item 16) and for the re-making of the glass for her piece, City Willows. Dated May 29, 1979.<br />
<br />
20) Typed note on thin white stationery in original envelope from J. Robert Orton of LaJolla, California, thanking Wilmarth for recently received materials and looking forward to a visit in New York in the next month. Orton claims to be good friends with Paula Cooper and Dan Weinberg, presumably one or both of whom connected him with Wilmarth. Dated March 12, 1982.<br />
<br />
21) 2 xeroxed or mimeographed pages of a handwritten letter on Studio for the First Amendment letterhead from Wilmarth to Michael Brillson, thanking him for consideration for the Chicago Board of Options commission and detailing his usual commission procedure. Dated 5/6/1982. The bottoms of both sheets are torn off, though no words are missing.<br />
<br />
22) Typed note on white stationery from Susan Douglas, secretary to Patsy Nasher. She appears to have sketched in black, blue, and red inks the chipped corner of the glass of My Divider, with measurements. Wilmarth has written in blue ball-point in the lower left a phone number and the sum $25,000. Paperclipped to this note is a cream sheet to which 4 Polaroids of the chipped glass are stapled. The lower left Polaroid has some sort of white residue on its surface. Note is dated September 21, 1982.<br />
<br />
23) 3 carbon copy pages of a letter about and invoice for the repair of the glass of My Divider, as well as re-installation at a new site and refinishing of the steel. Wilmarth mentions an enclosed diagram which is not to be found in this file. Dated 14 October 1982.<br />
<br />
24) Typed letter in original envelope from Richard Levitt of Minneapolis on Norwest Company letterhead thanking Wilmarth for the installation of his and his wife's new piece, which they love. Dated July 24, 1985.<br />
<br />
25) Handwritten (and difficult to decipher) note in black ink on cream stationery card from Penny Winton of Wayzata, Minnesota, expressing interest in some particular kinds of pieces and thanking Wilmarth for the catalogues he sent. Dated August 26, 1985. In original envelope.<br />
<br />
26) 2 sheets of small white stationery with a handwritten note in black ball-point from Kempf Hogan thanking Wilmarth for some writings he'd sent and sending along word of the enthusiasm viewers have expressed for Moses, presumably a Wilmarth piece said to be on view at the Cranbrook Academy of Art Museum. Dated October 4, 1985.<br />
<br />
27) Note in blue ink on green and white stationery postcard from Nancy Hess or Fess (or something similar?) of Washington, D.C., congratulating Wilmarth on a recent show (perhaps at Betty Cunningham's, as a Betty C. is mentioned?). Postmarked November 23, 1986.<br />
<br />
28) Typed note on NYU Medical Center letterhead from Dr. Fred J. Epstein to say that the first thing his wife did on his return from China was bring him to Wilmarth's new show. They would be interested in purchasing another piece if a payment plan could be worked out. Taped to bottom of sheet are two cut-out fragments of photographs of Epstein in China. Dated December 19, 1986.<br />
<br />
29) Handwritten note in black ink from Jerry [last name?] who seems to be another artist, perhaps. He thanks Wilmarth for his recent visit to Purchase, New York, to see his (presumably Jerry's) show. Jerry appears to have sent this note along with the gift of a picture of some kind, and also thanks Wilmarth for a gift of some dye transfer prints. Dated 2-19-1987.<br />
<br />
30) Typed note on small sheet of cream stationery from Jack Bershad of Philadelphia, thanking Wilmarth for the book of Delancey Backs. Dated February 18, 1987.<br />
<br />
31) An effusive handwritten note of thanks in black ball-point on gray stationery from Mrs. Irving (Pam?) Segal for Wilmarth's recent visit and a re-installation. Undated.<br />
<br />
32) Small sheet of legal pad paper on which Wilmarth has written a phone number for a Wanda Hansen and another for "Joyce + George." No date indicated.<br />
<br />
33) Torn strip of cream paper. On recto, Susan Wilmarth has written a note to Chris in graphite (signed in upper right in black ink) telling him to call Irwin Berman who would like to buy a drawing. At bottom she wrote in blue ball-point "(over)," and on recto is a second note from her to Chris to say that she's going to the Met that night to look at Monet if he wants to join her. Neither side is dated.</dd>
