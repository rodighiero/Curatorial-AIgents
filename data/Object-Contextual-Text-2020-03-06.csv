The glaze colors (including turquoise, yellow, white, and black) as well as the animal and plant motifs depicted on these objects largely followed Mesopotamian models. From the destruction level at Hasanlu, in northwest Iran, dated to circa 800 BCE, come glazed tiles and vessels, among these a beaker painted with an unusually loose, abstract pattern consisting of triangles and dots.[1] The two jars discussed here bear patterns similar to those of the Hasanlu beaker and several other vessels reportedly from the site or surroundings of Ziwiye, an Iron Age citadel southeast of Hasanlu.[2]   The 1947 find at Ziwiye of a rich assemblage of artifacts, the so-called Ziwiye Treasure, led to further clandestine excavations and established the site as an antiquities-market label, which also attracted forgeries.[3] Although documented excavations in the area appear not to have provided exact parallels for the lidded “Ziwiye-type” containers, they have revealed glazed vessels and tiles.[4] Decorated with floral patterns as well as ibexes, sphinxes, and other mythological creatures, these finds attest that Mannea, as the region was called in the ninth to seventh centuries BCE, produced, or at least had access to, skillfully made glazed artifacts. The two Calderwood jars were perhaps intended for cosmetics. The rectangular example (cat. 1) has two pierced lug handles and four stumpy feet; the appearance and ill fit of its slightly domed lid suggest that it may not belong to the jar. Turquoise glaze lines frame the edges and divide the top of the lid into four triangles, which are filled with dots in the same color. The four sides of the vessel are decorated in a turquoise zigzag pattern. The standing triangle at the center of each side is white with black dots; the hanging triangle extending over each corner is yellow with turquoise dots. Rim and handles are covered in turquoise glaze, which also extends partway down on the interior. The jar is composed of numerous fragments, with some fills and inpainting.   The cylindrical jar (cat. 2) has pierced lug handles and a dome-shaped lid that is pierced at the center. The vessel bears a battlement pattern outlined in turquoise and filled with yellow glaze. Spikes project above and below, and dots punctuate both the pattern itself and the spaces between the spikes. The lid features a cross-shaped motif outlined in turquoise and filled with yellow in two of the quadrants. There are turquoise dots in each of the segments. Much of the glaze is worn off and partly restored in modern paint. Thermoluminesence analysis has confirmed the authenticity of the two Calderwood jars.[5] They are made not of clay but of faience, a quartz-based material. Scientific examination has shown that the glaze is a soda-lime glass derived from plant ash, as is common for this period. The glazes are colored by lead antimonate with various quantities of iron oxide for the yellow (Naples yellow), by copper for the turquoise, and by manganese for the purplish black.[6] The same colorants were used for glazed bricks from Achaemenid Persian Susa.[7]    Susanne Ebbinghaus    [1] Dyson 1968, 90,101, fig. xxxix; Dyson 1989, 9, fig. 10b; Fukai 1981, 8-9, figs. 9-10.

147861,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"3   Dish with green splashed decoration Iraq, Abbasid period, 9th century[1] Buff-colored earthenware with patches of green (copper) running in clear lead glaze 4.1 × 21.2 cm (1 5/8 × 8 3/8 in.) 2002.50.104   Published: McWilliams 2002a, 13, fig. 4.   Although the collection contains important pre-Islamic antecedents in the Ziwiye wares (cats. 1 and 2), Norma Jean Calderwood’s initial focus was on the glazed ceramics of the Islamic era. This green-splashed dish, the earliest Islamic ceramic vessel in the collection,[2] represents the glazed luxury wares being produced in Abbasid Iraq by the late eighth to early ninth century. The rounded walls and slightly everted rim of this dish recall those of Tang white wares. Whether the production of color-splashed ceramics in the Islamic world was an independent development or was also inspired by wares imported from China is still unresolved.[3] A copper oxide was applied in patches on the exterior and interior rim of this dish before it was fired upright. The green patches flowed freely in the clear glaze, pooling at the center into a shape serendipitously resembling a lotus blossom.   Ceramics with colorants running in a clear glaze were broadly popular and widely produced in the early Islamic era; wasters have been found from Afrasiyab, in Uzbekistan, to Fustat, in Egypt.[4] Because this visual effect could be achieved through various techniques, assigning place and time of production to these wares is often difficult.[5] Calderwood acquired this dish as an example of eastern Iranian splash ware, but on the basis of its well-formed foot, its finely potted profile with recurved rim, and its lack of secondary incised decoration, it is here attributed to Iraq.   Mary McWilliams   [1] The bowl is of “ancient origin,” according to the results of thermoluminescence analysis carried out at the Research Laboratory of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1973.  [2] Calderwood acquired a small dish, cat. 50, as an example of the green-glazed wares of the late Umayyad period, but it was more likely created in early modern Vietnam or China, according to Robert D.

165499,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"4   Fragmentary bowl with seated figure holding a beaker Iraq, Basra, Abbasid period, 10th century Buff-colored earthenware painted with luster (silver and copper) over white lead alkali glaze opacified with tin 6.8 × 22.2 cm (2 11/16 × 8 3/4 in.) 2002.50.84   Published: McWilliams, 2004, 11.   Luster painting is often cited as the greatest contribution of Islamic potters to the history of ceramics. This difficult and costly decorative technique, which requires two firings, appears to have originated in the late eighth or early ninth century in the Iraqi port town of Basra, where it flourished for some two centuries.[1] Abbasid lusterwares enjoyed immense success and prestige and have been found along trade routes from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Strait of Malacca.[2] The four monochrome luster bowls in the Calderwood Collection represent what is often considered the last phase of Basra luster production.[3] In the late tenth century, luster painting on ceramics spread outward from Iraq, with brilliant, albeit differing, manifestations in Egypt, Spain, and Italy to the west and Syria and Iran to the east.    Although slightly more than half plaster fill, this bowl retains the image of an arresting figure, probably female, with a riveting gaze.[4] She has long, wavy locks of hair and is adorned with earrings, a necklace, a decorated textile band (ṭirāz) on her arm, and an elaborately checkerboard-patterned lower garment.[5] Her seated position and the triangular beaker that she holds at chest level (in a six-fingered hand) suggest the princely pastime of wine drinking.    This bowl, unlike most lusterwares of the same phase, shows the figure isolated against a plain white ground. The glazed base bears a fragmentary, illegible inscription in Kufic script.    Mary McWilliams   [1] This discussion follows the developmental chronology proposed for luster ceramics in Mason 2004, 23–62 and 156–68. [2] Hallett 2010, 76 [3] For a divergent opinion, see Philon 1980, 73.

Half of her head, starting at the widow’s peak, and the top portion of the implement in her raised hand are now plaster fill. Like the figure on the previous bowl (cat. 4), this woman has long, wavy hair and wears earrings and ṭirāz armbands. She carries a globular bottle, which again signals the courtly enjoyment of intoxicating beverages. Leaves of elongated teardrop form and a field of V-shaped marks fill the space around her. The luster decoration on the exterior consists of concentric circles amid dots and dashes, which can also be seen on other bowls in the collection (cats. 4, 6, and 7). The bottom of the foot is glazed and marked with four dabs of luster.    Mary McWilliams",NULL,NULL
165491,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"6   Bowl with rooster and fish Iraq, Basra, Abbasid period, 10th century[1] Buff-colored earthenware painted with luster (silver and copper) over white lead alkali glaze opacified with tin 5.9 × 23.2 cm (2 5/16 × 9 1/8 in.) 2002.50.72   Published: McWilliams 2004, 3, 11, fig 2.   Repaired from about twenty fragments, but with only small losses, this bowl is decorated with two startled-looking animals— a rooster, and, in its beak, a fish. Their wide-eyed energy is sustained by other sharply angled elements of the design: fins and tail feathers, coxcomb, and fluttering scarf.[2] These creatures have long carried positive associations: the rooster, as the harbinger of dawn, symbolizes hope, while the fish suggests bounty. In religious contexts, the rooster also developed more specifically auspicious connotations: according to a popular epigram attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, he crows when he sees an angel; in Christian tradition, his invigorating sound recalls the faltering to their faith. The glazed base of this bowl bears an undecipherable inscription in Kufic script.   Mary McWilliams   [1] The bowl was last fired between 700 and 1200 years ago, according to the results of thermoluminescence analysis carried out by Oxford Authentication Ltd. in 2011.  [2] In Grube 1994, 38, cat. 25, Peter Morgan, referring to a bowl in the Khalili Collection, London, describes a similar adornment on a bird’s head as “the classical Sasanian imperial ribbon.”",NULL,NULL

The Arabic word for “blessing” (baraka) is written twice below the curious four-legged beast that fills this small bowl. The slender legs of the animal and its hooves with dewclaws probably indicate that it was intended to be a deer, a creature admired for its beauty and prized by hunters as game. Its neck, head, and upper back are an early restoration, poorly painted on plaster fill.[2]   Mary McWilliams   [1] This bowl is of “ancient origin,” according to the results of thermoluminescence analysis carried out by the Research Laboratory of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1973. [2] The original head probably resembled that of a beast on a monochrome luster fragment (Benaki Museum, Athens, 231) illustrated in Philon 1980, 151, fig. 335.

165476,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"8   Bowl with two birds circling an inscription Iran, Nishapur, Samanid period, 10th century[1] Reddish earthenware covered in whitish slip and painted with green (chromium) slip under clear lead glaze 5.9 × 20.7 cm (2 5/16 × 8 1/8 in.) 2002.50.57   Published: McWilliams 2004, 11.   Potters working during the reign of the Samanid dynasty (819–999) in northeastern Iran and Central Asia produced some of the most impressive and distinctive wares in the history of Islamic art. One of their most successful decorative techniques involved the use of slips—colored clays in solution—both to envelop the reddish earthenware body of vessels and to add surface designs.    The body of this bowl, for example, is covered completely in a whitish slip, with a lively design in olive green painted over it. The green color is produced by fine particles of a chromium compound. Within a rim decorated with running crescents appear two wide-eyed birds, positioned breast-to-tail, who pinwheel around an Arabic inscription in foliated Kufic that reads, “Blessing to him” (baraka lahu). On the exterior, three circles enclosing parallel diagonal lines alternate with three downward-pointing arrows. The crescents, pop-eyed animals, benevolent inscription, and circles echo designs on tenth-century monochrome lusterwares produced in Basra (see cats. 4–7). Slip-painted imitations of Basra vessels seem to have been a specialty of the potters of Nishapur, in northeastern Iran.[2]    A clear glaze with a slight greenish tinge covers the interior and exterior of this bowl, including its beveled, slightly concave base. The vessel has been put back together from fragments, with painted plaster filling in losses in the wing of the inverted bird.    Mary McWilliams   [1] The bowl was last fired between 800 and 1300 years ago, according to the results of thermoluminescence analysis carried out by Oxford Authentication Ltd. in 2011.

(4 3/16 × 3 7/8 in). Handle and rim: 12.2 cm (4 13/16 in.) 2002.50.91   Published: McWilliams 2004, 11.    Among the most impressive ceramics produced during the reign of the Samanids are the epigraphic wares, so called because their sole or main decoration consists of stately Kufic script. An austere Arabic inscription, which may be read as “The noblest thing is the well-being of my guest” (ashraf al-shay nuzlī al-munā), lends surprising majesty to this small jug. Written in black, four words are evenly spaced around the bulbous body, with an almond-shaped lozenge marking the end of the phrase. The tall ascending letters curve gently to the left. The intersection of the neck and body is ringed by a black line, which breaks into a looping motif at the front of the jug, opposite the handle. The black slip is raised slightly above the white surface; a carving tool has been used to sharpen its contours. The jug has been reassembled from thirteen fragments; small losses filled with plaster have been painted white. The reddish earthenware body, including the flat base, is covered entirely in white slip and a slightly yellowish clear glaze.

165532,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"10   Bowl inscribed with a saying of ʿAli ibn Abi Talib Iran, Nishapur, Samanid period, 10th century Reddish earthenware covered in white slip and painted with black (manganese and iron) under clear lead glaze 6.1 × 21.5 cm (2 3/8 × 8 7/16 in.) 2002.50.83   Written around the rim of this bowl in a “new style” Kufic, with ascenders deflected abruptly to the left, is an epigram in Arabic attributed to ʿAli ibn Abi Talib, the son-in- law of the Prophet Muhammad, praising knowledge and manly virtue: “Knowledge is the noblest of personal qualities, and love is the highest of pedigrees” (al-ʿilm ashraf al-aḥsāb wʾal-mawadda ashbak al-ansāb).[1] A pear-shaped ornament rising out of the last letter of the last word (al-ansāb) marks the end of the inscription. Written across the center is a single Arabic word, aḥmad, which appears frequently on Samanid epigraphic bowls. In this context it is usually construed not as the signature of a potter but as a blessing: “most praiseworthy.” Proverbs praising knowledge and exhorting the owner to various forms of virtuous conduct appear frequently on these elegantly inscribed epigraphic wares, suggesting that they were appreciated by a class of users who placed high value on learning and ethical behavior. On the interior and exterior of this well-potted bowl, the entire pinkish-buff ceramic body, including the beveled, slightly concave base, has been covered in white slip and clear glaze. The vessel is fragmentary; the last word of the inscription has been partially reconstructed on a plaster fill.

165424,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"11   Bowl with foliated and plaited inscription Uzbekistan, Samarkand, Samanid period, 10th century[1] Reddish earthenware covered in white slip and painted with black (manganese and iron) under clear lead glaze 8.6 × 25.5 cm (3 3/8 × 10 1/16 in.) 2002.50.89   Among the more extravagant developments in Samanid epigraphic wares is the elaboration of Arabic script—occasionally, as here, to the point of illegibility. The inscription on this bowl is a compendium of the major decorative devices and themes that embellish these wares, including the dramatic elongation or extension of letters and their ornamentation with plaiting, arcs, loops, knots, foliate terminals, and interlacings that seem to spring from their middles or the ligatures between them.[2] The most exuberant decorative devices occupy the upper zone of the inscription, that is, toward the center of the bowl.    Underlying the proliferation of ornament is an essentially rhythmic structure based on repetition of near-identical elements. Occurring three times in the band, and dividing it roughly into thirds, is a complicated and additive form of the letter alif, the tallest element in the inscription. Each alif bears three loops on its staff and at its top deflects rightward in a foliate terminal. Its baseline stretches to the right and has been transformed into a split leaf, from which a tendril curls upward and rightward and terminates in another split leaf. The tendril in turn joins, or nearly joins, a curving and branching foliate outgrowth that reinforces the rhythm established by the alif. Less regularly spaced are three plaited ornaments that spring once from a ligature and twice from a closed rectangular letter. Small rosettes composed of four dots enliven the interstitial space of the inscription band and mark the center of the bowl.    This bowl is well and thinly potted of a fine-grained earthenware. The exterior and interior are covered in a creamy white slip under a clear glaze. The flat and very slightly concave base is partially slipped and glazed. Only the interior is decorated; its brownish-black slip stands slightly raised above the surface, and a carving tool has been used to sharpen contours and to articulate the plaiting, twisting, and overlapping of the letters. The bowl has been reassembled from numerous fragments, with one notable loss on the rim.    Mary McWilliams   [1] The bowl was last fired between 700 and 1200 years ago, according to the results of thermoluminescence analysis carried out by Oxford Authentication Ltd. in 2011.

160273,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"12   Bowl with birds and inscriptions Iran, probably Nishapur, Samanid period, 10th century[1] Reddish earthenware covered in white slip and painted with black (manganese and iron) under clear lead glaze 7.8 × 25 cm (3 1/16 × 9 13/16 in.) 2002.50.115   A pair of inward-facing birds seeming to revolve counterclockwise occupies the walls in this bowl. Their wings are formed of split leaves articulated in reserve, and their tails recall the forked scarves (or tresses) of human figures on Samanid yellow-field wares (cats. 18 and 19) or the boots worn by the seated figure on an Abbasid bowl (cat. 4).    Each bird has the Arabic word for “blessing” (baraka) written in Kufic script across its body, and each holds in its beak a split leaf; one leaf is considerably blurred by the running of the black slip in the glaze. From the number of similar bowls that have survived, one can surmise that these motifs and their composition were highly favored in the early Islamic era.[2]   Overall, the bowl is sparsely decorated: the interior features only the birds, a black rim, and a pair of comma-like motifs in the center, and the outside is left entirely plain except for white slip and unevenly applied clear, greenish-tinged glaze. The slip and glaze only partially cover the beveled base. Sagger marks at the center, as well as the flow of the black pigment toward the rim, indicate that the bowl was fired upside down.

With its pure white slip, precise calligraphy, and perfectly clear glaze, this deep-walled bowl embodies the finest qualities of Samanid epigraphic wares. Most surviving examples of this class of ceramics reproduce benedictory phrases or popular proverbs. More rarely, as here and on one other bowl in the collection (cat. 10) they record sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad and his Companions. Beginning in his own lifetime, Muhammad’s example was considered an important guide for how people should conduct their lives. In the early centuries of the Islamic era, sayings attributed to and anecdotes about him were collected and analyzed by numerous authors. The large and complex body of literature that resulted from this immense effort is known as hadith.    The outer inscription on this bowl is written in black slip and records a saying attributed to the Prophet: “Modesty is a branch of faith, and faith is in paradise” (al-ḥayā shuʿba min al-īmān waʾl-īmān fiʾl-janna). The inner inscription, in red slip, contains a similar dictum credited to ʿAli ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad’s son-in- law and the fourth orthodox caliph of Islam: “Greed is a sign of poverty” (al- ḥirṣʿalāniya al-faqr).[2] Because each inscription is written in a ring, the calligrapher inserted a single-word invocation to mark the beginning: in the outer circle, “felicity” (al-yumn), and in the inner one, “health” (al-salāma).    This bowl has been reassembled from about fifteen fragments, with only minimal losses. The white slip and clear glaze completely cover the vessel, including its flat, slightly concave base.    Mary McWilliams   [1] The bowl was last fired between 800 and 1400 years ago, according to the results of thermoluminescence analysis carried out by Oxford Authentication Ltd. in 2011. [2] The same proverb occurs in red slip on a closely related bowl offered at auction: see Sotheby’s 2006b, 94, lot 92.

A benevolent Arabic inscription popular for ceramics of the Samanid era is here rendered in imposing, wedge-shaped Kufic script; it can be interpreted as “Blessings and favor to its owner” (baraka wa niʿma li-ṣāḥibihi).[1] Words or parts of words are enclosed in contour panels outlined in red and separated by fields of black dots, a decorative treatment typical of wares found in Samarkand.[2] These panels surround slightly sketchy lines in black and red slip, which in turn enclose a motif of two circles joined at the center by a black dot with cruciform protruding lines. The black outline of the rim is alternately smooth and dentate.    The exterior, including the flat, slightly concave base, is undecorated except for a covering of white slip and beautifully clear glaze. The bowl has been put back together from numerous fragments, with minimal plaster fills.

Although painted with apparent dash, the colorful decoration of this bowl is carefully composed. The design is laid out in three registers: an Arabic word meaning “harmony” (al-wifāq) occupies the middle, and above and below it are long-necked birds with outstretched wings. Like the beginning and end letters of the inscription, the birds’ heads and leaf-like wingtips terminate at the red circular boundary. Freely painted running crescents and a black line enclose the lively composition. Combining Arabic script with birds became popular among potters in the early Islamic era. On this bowl, where inscription and birds are equally stylized and animated, the decorative formula has proved especially felicitous.     Most of the black decoration on the bowl is painted in a relatively inert black slip. By contrast, the contour panels are dotted with a black pigment containing chromite, which stains the surrounding glaze light yellow. To date, ceramic vessels with yellow-staining black have been excavated only in Nishapur.[2] The outside of the bowl is undecorated except for the white slip and clear glaze, which has a slight iridescence. The flat base is lightly covered in the slip and partially glazed.   Mary McWilliams   [1] The bowl was last fired between 700 and 1200 years ago, according to the results of thermoluminescence analysis carried out by Oxford Authentication Ltd. in 2011.

165419,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"16   Bowl with a cheetah standing on the back of a horse Iran, Nishapur, Samanid period, 10th century[1] Buff-colored earthenware painted with black (manganese and iron), yellow (lead-tin), and green (copper) under clear lead glaze 7.4 × 18.6 cm (2 15/16 × 7 5/16 in.) 2002.50.68   Published: Reed 2005, 1.   Figural designs on polychrome ceramics offer tantalizing and often puzzling glimpses into the complex society of the Samanid realm, now divided between northeastern Iran and Uzbekistan.[2] The majority of these wares are made of buff-colored earthenware decorated with lively, and often freely rendered, figural images painted in bright colors under clear glaze. The decoration of this small bowl has been executed with exceptional detail and care. Fluid and confident strokes of black slip delineate a crested bird, a spotted feline, and a well-groomed horse. These forms are filled or dotted with green and yellow. The feline and the horse raise their right forelegs; they both sport ankle bands and scalloped collars. The horse has a cropped mane, a knotted tail, and curling fetlocks. Filling its body is a bold pseudo-inscription in floriated and spiraling Kufic script. The top of its eye is defined by two extended parallel lines; this distinctive treatment is occasionally found in figural wares excavated in Nishapur.[3] The feline may be identified as a cheetah by the black stripe descending from its eye.    The vignette of a collared feline on the back of an imposing horse may be a shorthand reference to the costly, prestigious, and ancient sport of hunting with cheetahs.[4] Capable of short bursts of extraordinary speed, cheetahs were usually set on gazelles, rabbits, and other fleet game, but because stamina was not one of their virtues, they had to be conveyed to the hunt. One of the cheetah trainer’s more demanding tasks was to teach his charge to ride pillion on the back of a horse moving at any speed.    The exterior decoration of this bowl consists of pendant leaf shapes painted in an alternating pattern: a buff leaf with an interior dot-dash- dot device alternates with a colored leaf, sequentially yellow or green. No slip is detectable over the light buff ceramic body. The entire bowl, including the flat, slightly concave base, is covered in a clear glaze. The bowl has been reassembled from at least three large fragments and has minor losses and repairs along the rim.   Mary McWilliams   [1] The bowl was last fired between 800 and 1300 years ago, according to the results of thermoluminescence analysis carried out by Oxford Authentication Ltd. in 2004.

A prominent bird facing left dominates the interior of this small bowl. The artist has whimsically concocted a creature with a trilobed crest, a cere (protrusion above the bill), rings of multicolored feathers around the neck and breast, and a yellow wing. The bird’s salient feature, however, is a fan-shaped tail, which above all else suggests that it is a peacock.[2] There is a single, legible inscription in Syriac between the bird’s back and tail: ʿaynā, meaning “eye” or “fount.” On the upper walls beneath the rim, a band of scrolling triangular leaves is bordered by black lines.    No slip is detectable over the light buff ceramic body of the bowl. Except for its flat, slightly concave base, which is only partially glazed, it appears to have been covered in a clear glaze. Its condition is difficult to assess, because much of the interior surface is coated with a modern varnish. It is clearly fragmentary, reassembled from numerous small pieces, and has considerable overpainting along the rim, the scrolling band, and the lower body of the peacock.

Examination under ultraviolet light reveals that almost two-thirds of this bowl has been overpainted. Happily, most of the large standing figure, from the top of the flattened head to the tip of the pointed shoes, is original. Details of the garment, such as neckline, lapels, and pattern of the skirt, are original ceramic surface. The figure’s shoulders and upper arms have been repainted, as has the leafy projection from the piece of fruit he or she holds in an upraised hand.[2] The bird on the left is mostly original, but the other is overpainted, as is almost eighty percent of the upper walls and rim. The exterior is also heavily resurfaced.

Perhaps a bull’s head is represented, but the blurring of the black pigment in the glaze has obscured the artist’s intentions here and elsewhere. The rendering of the hands is equally ambiguous, possibly meant to suggest the thumb and knuckles of a clenched fist. The hand reaching backward appears to hold a leafy branch.[2] The space around the figure is filled with a miscellany of motifs, including a flower, a palmette, fragmentary letters in Kufic script, and a bird. Groups of four or five short lines divide the rim into five sections, colored either green or yellow.    This bowl closely resembles figural wares with buff-colored bodies reported by Charles Wilkinson to have come from excavations at Nishapur.[3] Here, however, the off-white background is obtained from slip covering a reddish ceramic fabric, and the yellow background results from staining from fine chromite particles, rather than the more customary lead-tin or lead-antimony. The base, which is slightly concave and beveled, is only partially covered by the slip. The bowl, once broken, is in good condition, having been put back together from at least four major fragments. On the interior, overpainting is largely limited to the center: the figure’s collar and shoulders, his groin, and the upper lapels of his torso.

The decoration on the interior of this vessel is characteristic of slip-painted wares now generally attributed to workshops in a region south of the Caspian Sea.[1] Typically, as here, the design of these bowls is dominated by a single large, leftward-facing bird with distended belly, elaborately crested head, and two-colored, bifurcated tail. Birds and surrounding flowers are often outlined in a darker color that may be topped with tiny white dots; white dots also accent dark spots on the bird’s body.    Off-white slip and green-tinged glaze completely coat the interior of this bowl. On the exterior, the slip only patchily covers the walls, and the glaze is restricted to the area around the rim. The concave base is uncoated. The bowl has been reassembled from about ten fragments, with plaster replacing losses in the lower left quadrant of the center, and it retains earlier and rather awkward overpainting of the bird’s lower belly and legs.

The development of fritware in the twelfth century opened new paths in ceramics production. By adding large quantities of quartz to the clay, potters could make white-bodied vessels with thinner walls, more delicate shapes, and greater durability. Some of these fine objects were coated with blue, turquoise, purple, or colorless glazes.    This cup is decorated with repeated human heads molded in relief.[2] The lobed rim follows the contours of the projecting heads, which feature large, almond-eyed faces. The deep blue glaze covers the interior and exterior body of the cup and has flowed onto the base. On one side, it has deteriorated, becoming iridescent.

Its relief decoration features a broad band of confronting peacocks, their necks intertwined, alternating with pear-shaped floral motifs. Above this main band is a narrower one with scrolling vines. The foot of the ewer has been left unglazed. On one section of the peacock band the glaze has pooled, perhaps due to an error in the firing process. The vessel has been repaired, especially in the area of the mouth.

Like luster painting, mīnāʾī is a costly process that requires a second firing. Seljuk- Atabeg period mīnāʾī wares are tentatively attributed to the city of Kashan, in central Iran.[2] In the center of this bowl two harpies (composite bird-women) are turned toward each other, their tail feathers joining overhead in an ogival arch. In Islamic lands these mythical creatures were associated astrologically with the planet Mercury and were considered generally auspicious. Foliate arabesques sprout from the harpies’ joined tails and fill the space below their feet.

An enthroned ruler with attendants occupies the center of this bowl. Pairs of birds are positioned above and below the group. On the walls of the vessel, encircling the central scene, are seated figures, also in pairs (the single individual results from a modern repair with an alien sherd). Parts of their headgear extend horizontally outward, as if lifted by a breeze.    Although birds are commonly shown near thrones on mīnāʾī wares,[1] the combination of birds, enthroned ruler, and windblown spectators on this bowl suggests a popular story from the great epic poem of Persian literature, the Shāhnāma. According to the tale, the foolish king Kay Kavus wished to fly through the air, so he attached to his throne hungry eagles and, just beyond their reach, legs of lamb. In their effort to get at the meat, the powerful birds managed to lift the throne and its occupant into the air, but as soon as they tired, the whole contrivance fell back to earth. To the great astonishment of the spectators, the king escaped injury.[2]    The interior rim of the bowl is decorated with a repeating pseudo-inscription in Kufic script, and the plain white walls of the exterior with a cursive inscription, large portions of which are overpainted restoration, as can be seen in the profile view.[3] Supplementing the red, green, and blue mīnāʾī colors of the composition, gilding is used to highlight details such as the throne and the observers’ armbands. The bowl has been assembled from several fragments, with painted plaster used to fill in the losses.

Luster painting on ceramics provided a metallic golden sheen, first on earthenware from ninth-and tenth-century Iraq (see cats. 4–7) and later on fritware from Iran, where it was used to great effect from the twelfth to the fourteenth century. The luster, applied after the first firing of a glazed tile or vessel, consisted of oxides of copper and silver. Different concentrations of these metals, in addition to variations in the reducing atmosphere of the kiln during the second firing, resulted in tones ranging from reddish to yellowish. In Iran, specifically in Kashan,[2] generations of potters produced exquisite ceramics in the luster technique. Due to the predominance of copper, the luster of these ceramics appears reddish.    The interior of this bowl is divided into eight equal sections by lines, embellished with dots and twining tendrils, that spring 189 from triangular arabesques and terminate with pairs of small, silhouetted birds toward the rim. Each section contains a palmette-filled pendant. Around the rim runs an angular pseudo-inscription. Paired lines divide the exterior of the bowl into sections, which are filled with loosely painted scrolls.    The twining tendrils and the palmette-enclosing pendants on the interior of this bowl are very common in Persian lusterwares. The bowl is intact, and the quality of its luster is remarkable. The white glaze does not cover the foot, which the potter would have held when dipping the vessel into the glazing compound before firing.

The interior of this impressive vessel is decorated with two large-scale, seated figures whose long-sleeved garments signal their courtly status. Ṭirāz bands on the upper arms of one figure’s caftan offer an additional indication of wealth and prestige. A bird in the tree between the pair and a second bird below them suggest a garden setting. The background is decorated with tiny spirals incised in the luster. These background spirals, combined with the representation of the figures in reserve, are characteristic of the so-called Kashan style of luster ceramics.[1]   Bands on the wall and rim of the vessel contain Persian words that are mostly illegible due to the compromised condition of the dish. The inner inscription is written in luster on a white ground; the one on the rim is incised on a luster ground, now quite abraded. All that can be deciphered of the inner inscription is “Rustam from an infatuated heart . . .” (Rustam zi dil-i shaydā dar nakard . . .).[2]   A courtly couple with similar facial features and details of costume appears on a luster bowl dated to 1211 and signed by the artist Muhammad ibn Abi al-Hasan.[3] Prior to its arrival at the Harvard Art Museums, cat. 34 was reconstructed from many small pieces and the entire inner surface covered in clear varnish.

This fragmentary tile, reassembled from four pieces, depicts a narrative scene closely related to those in contemporary and later manuscript paintings.[1] Through an archway, a couple is shown in bed under a patterned cover. A tall candle in a plaited metal candlestick illuminates the interior of the room, and a similarly ornamented ewer appears further to the right. The partially visible bow and arrows likely belong to the man and indicate his princely activities. The fish at the bottom of the scene and the flowers sprouting above the couple create a dreamlike ambience. A figure, likely a servant, stands at left, perhaps outside the room. Bordering the scene, a Persian inscription, reserved in white on a blue ground, is partially legible.

If the cobalt used to decorate Yuan and early Ming blue-and-white porcelains was initially imported from Iran, then Chinese potters more than repaid the favor in the form of exported decorative motifs.[1] Avidly collected in Islamic lands, Chinese blue-and-white porcelain wares exerted enormous influence on Muslim potters of the fifteenth through the seventeenth century.   Produced in northeastern Iran in the second half of the fifteenth century, this impressive dish combines decorative solutions developed during the reign of two dynasties in China.[2] Antecedents for the “wave and crest” motif along the rim and the “double scroll” on the outside wall can be found in Yuan (1271–1368) blue-and-white wares, while the fleshy peonies in the center derive from Ming (1368–1644) prototypes. The curiously restless and asymmetrical nature of the interior composition results from the zones of the circle being divided into odd and even units—three peonies in the center, eight floral sprays along the wall, and six wave-and-crest motifs on the rim.[3]   Although the glaze has deteriorated somewhat, this dish is overall in fine condition. Put back together from a few large fragments, it has minimal losses.   Mary McWilliams   [1] Golombek et al. 1996, 7.

The court studio provided designs to semi-autonomous workshops in Iznik, which manufactured tiles for numerous large-scale imperial projects.    With its white ground and foliate decoration in brilliant cobalt blue, emerald green, turquoise, and slightly raised red, this square tile exemplifies the technical achievements of the second half of the century. The dominant motif is a composite flower, which alternates direction across the middle of the tile. Serrated leaves known as saz grow from the base of each palmette. Smaller bisected palmettes of a different form are horizontally positioned at the top and bottom edges of the tile. When this tile was juxtaposed with others of the same design, a continuous repeating pattern resulted.[1]   Identical tiles can now be seen under the pendentives on the north and south walls of the chamber of Sultan Murad III (r. 1574–95), built in 1578–79 in the harem of Topkapı Palace by the illustrious architect Sinan.[2] It is likely, however, that these tiles are not original to the room itself [3] but were made for a different part of the harem, either later in Murad’s reign[4] or during that of his successor Mehmed III (r. 1595–1603),[5] and were subsequently reinstalled in Murad’s chamber, perhaps after damage caused by a fire or an earthquake.[6] Stylistically similar tiles are found in their original location in the 1585–86 mosque of Ramazan Efendi in Istanbul.[7]   Ayşin Yoltar-Yıldırım                                                                                                                    [1] A panel of these tiles, showing their continuous design, is in the Tareq Rajab Museum.

A rotund bird with backward-turning head neatly fills the interior. Around the exterior, a band defined by two painted lines encloses single dots alternating with beribboned fans; paired lines circle the inside and outside of the foot ring. The bowl has been put back together from fragments; plaster fills shaped like half-moons complete the rim.   Along with the fans and floating ribbons, the brown rim points to the influence of Chinese export porcelain wares known as Kraak, which were produced in vast quantities to meet international demand. Potters working in late Safavid Iran painted an imitation of the colored rim dressing that in the second half of the seventeenth century was applied to these Chinese export wares to guard against chipping.[2]   Elegantly or hastily painted, birds are a common motif on blue-and-white ceramics from China and Iran.[3] In the late Safavid period, artists produced beautiful drawings and paintings of birds. These works on paper usually feature generic songbirds perched on flowering branches; only rarely can their species be identified. The combination of bird and flowering branch was also rendered in luxury textiles, with an occasional butterfly or moth added to the mix.[4]   The squat bird on this bowl lacks a perch. With wings embellished by veined lotus leaves, it was clearly not intended as a botanical study. Nevertheless, its potbelly, square tail, banded and slightly lifted wings, and large feet suggest that it is a rock dove (feral pigeon), perhaps of a checkered variety. These omnipresent bluish-gray birds were much valued in Safavid Iran, where large mud-brick towers were constructed to house them by the thousands. Such pigeon towers served as collecting points for bird droppings, which, when mixed with soil and ash, were for centuries a prized fertilizer.[5]   Mary McWilliams   [1] This dish was sampled for thermoluminescence testing in 1973 by the Research Laboratory of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The result was inconclusive, possibly due to a contaminated sample or because thermoluminescence testing is less accurate for relatively modern ceramics. [2] Lally 2009, 12.

Crowe assigns the two bowls to the last decades of Safavid reign, circa 1666–1738. Quail-like birds surrounded by veined leaves also appear on a series of bottles in the Victoria and Albert Museum that Crowe assigns to the reign of Shah ʿAbbas II (1642–66): ibid., 148–49, cats. 226–30.

Handle to spout: 18.5 cm (7 1/4 in.) 2002.50.67   Published: McWilliams 2004, 11.   Breezily rendered Chinese decorative motifs in two shades of cobalt blue decorate the surface of this ewer. A border composed of cloudlike ruyi motifs separates chrysanthemum scrolls painted freely around the pear-shaped belly and rendered in reserve on the shoulder. Crisscrossing lines—possibly vestigial plantain leaves—pattern the tapering neck. Hash marks resembling the Chinese character shou (longevity) are evenly spaced along the spout. Except for the loss of the tip of the spout (now restored), the vessel is in fine, unbroken condition, retaining a glossy surface.   Although varying in proportion, the general form of this ewer, with its pear-shaped body, tapering spout, curving handle, neck ringed by torus molding, and flaring mouth, was rendered in metal or ceramic in Iran, India, and Turkey from the sixteenth through the nineteenth century.[1] The particular variant seen here, in which the curving handle joins a cup-shaped mouth above a prominent knob, appears to have been popular in late Safavid ceramics; ewers with these features have survived in a range of decorative techniques including monochrome relief, luster, and underglaze painting.[2] The imitation shou mark appears as decorative fill on a handful of late Safavid blue-and-white wares attributed to the reign (1666–94) of the Safavid ruler Shah Sulayman.[3]    Mary McWilliams   [1] Jean Soustiel dates a ewer of similar shape with blue-and-white floral and imbricate patterning to the second half of the fifteenth century: see Soustiel 1985, 215, fig. 238.

This decoration is subtly rendered with pierced dots and incised lines that reveal the grayish body of the bowl beneath its white slip coating. A clear glaze fills the piercings and covers the entire vessel with the exception of the concave base.    Assigning this bowl to the eighteenth or nineteenth century runs counter to the results of the thermoluminescence analysis noted below, which suggest modern manufacture. The earlier dating is proposed for two reasons: first, the existence of two vessels acquired in Iran in the late nineteenth or very early twentieth century that also feature a decorative play between a grayish ceramic fabric and a white slip,2 and second, the fact that thermoluminescence is generally not as reliable for dating early modern ceramics as it is for medieval or ancient material.3 Despite numerous cracks, this bowl is intact.   Mary McWilliams   [1] The bowl was last fired within the past 100 years, according to the results of thermoluminescence analysis carried out by Oxford Authentication Ltd. in 2004.

A stylized chrysanthemum blossom embellishes the floor; it is set in a circular medallion and enclosed within the wide band of symmetrically disposed, geometric strapwork that enlivens the walls. Facing each other across the dish, two taotie, or ogre, masks interrupt the strapwork. Representing stylized waves, short, opposing bands of hatching, each arranged in a triangular configuration, decorate the everted lip. The dish rests on a low, wide, circular foot ring. Thin and transparent, the lead-fluxed, emerald-green glaze covers the interior of the dish but coats only the upper half of the undecorated exterior.   The kilns that produced this type of ware have not yet been discovered. Concurring that such ceramics reflect Chinese aesthetic canons but were made for the Southeast Asian market, scholars nonetheless disagree on the location of manufacture, some ascribing them to Vietnam, others to southeastern China. They also disagree about the dating of such pieces, some assigning them to the seventeenth century, others to the eighteenth or nineteenth.   The form and glaze color of this dish distantly recall the celadon-glazed chargers with barbed rims and raised edges produced at the Longquan kilns, Zhejiang Province, during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368).1 The form also echoes that of blue-and-white porcelain chargers produced at Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, in the mid-fourteenth century.[2]   Doubtless inspired by geometric decoration on Yuan-and Ming-dynasty carved lacquers and on so-called later Chinese bronzes—those produced from the Song dynasty (960–1279) onward—the strapwork decoration on this dish finds distant kinship in the decorative schemes of ceramics produced at the Putian kilns, in Fujian Province, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.[3] The debased taotie masks that interrupt the strapwork find close parallels among the masks on bronze vessels cast during the Ming and Qing dynasties.   A typical motif of Chinese ceramic decoration, the chrysanthemum symbolizes both autumn and literary pursuits. By the mid-fourteenth century, stylized waves comprising a series of concentric arcs had become a staple border motif in blue-and-white porcelain chargers produced at Jingdezhen.[4]   This dish was created through the use of a hump, or single-faced, mold—a hollow mound of fired stoneware that was placed at the center of the potter’s wheel. As the potter pressed prepared clay against the mold on the rotating wheel, the mold shaped the interior of the vessel and imparted its relief decoration, while the potter’s hands shaped the exterior and regulated the thickness of the walls.   Although Chinese potters began the widespread use of lead-fluxed glazes during the Eastern Han period (25–220), such low-firing lead glazes enjoyed their greatest popularity during the Tang dynasty (618–907).[5] Lead glazes generally fell from favor after the mid-eighth century but enjoyed a revival, first in the Liao (907–1125) and Jin (1115–1234) dynasties and then again in the late Ming and Qing periods; they also found favor in Vietnam from the thirteenth century onward. Vietnamese pieces typically mimic the forms and decorative schemes of Chinese stonewares and porcelains finished with high-fired, clear glazes rather than earthenwares embellished with lead glazes.[6]   The unusual Calderwood dish likely falls into this category of wares.

Note that John Pope refers to such waves as “concentric waves.” [5] As a fluxing agent, a compound of lead added to the glaze slurry in small measure intensifies the glaze color. Its primary function, though, is to lower the firing temperature, so that low-firing earthenwares can be coated with colorful glazes. [6] See Stevenson and Guy 1997, 276–77, cats. 189–92.

These bands vary in width, and the backgrounds alternate between black and turquoise. The wide neck bears an inscription in tall Kufic letters, repeating the Arabic word al-mulk (sovereignty). Scrolling, leafy tendrils run along three bands. Two others are occupied by figural motifs: just below the shoulder, seven haloed sphinxes, facing left, appear on a black ground, and, below them, five figures sit cross-legged among scrolling tendrils with kidney-shaped leaves. Some of the figures are bearded and others clean shaven, but all are haloed and wear black robes patterned in reserve. Although Calderwood acquired this albarello as a work of medieval Persian art, it is more likely the product of a revival of traditional styles and media that took place in Iran during the Pahlavi reign (1925–79).[2] In form and decoration, it evokes without exactly replicating ceramics from the Seljuk-Atabeg period.[3] Had the jar been intended as a forgery, the potter would have made it of white rather than plaster-covered pink fritware.   The albarello is intact, but in many places the glaze has deteriorated to a matte surface. The ceramic body is fine grained but soft. The plaster and turquoise glaze cover the jar inside and out, stopping short of the foot ring.   Mary McWilliams",NULL,NULL
148153,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"53   Mirror case with birds and flowers Iran, Qajar period, 18th–19th century Opaque and semi-opaque watercolor on prepared pasteboard under varnish [1] 15.4 × 19 cm (6 1/16 × 7 1/2 in.) 2002.50.106.A–B   Among the most characteristic and compelling art forms of the Qajar period (1779–1924) in Iran are works in “lacquer.” Technically distinct from East Asian lacquers, these are essentially an extension of traditional opaque watercolor painting on paper to three-dimensional forms; their general structure consists of a pasteboard support covered by a white ground, over which the decoration is painted in opaque watercolor, with a final coating of transparent shellac.[2]   Fashioned as an irregular octagon, this lidded mirror case depicts the popular pairing of rose and nightingale (gul va bulbul). This theme, which embraced bird-and-flower compositions more generally, proliferated during the Zand (1750–94) and Qajar dynastic eras, when it was represented in both paintings and ceramics. As in Persian poetry, it signified the Sufi concept of the lover (nightingale) who declares his longing for the beloved (rose)—a signification that could be taken literally, as an expression of earthly love, or metaphorically and spiritually, as the soul’s yearning for union with God.   The singing nightingale on the cover of this mirror case is positioned amid a dense spray of mixed flowers, a full-blown rose towering above all others. Interwoven with the stem of the rose is the woody branch of a fruit tree, studded with pink buds and blossoms. A small, winged insect hovers next to one of the rosebuds. The base of the case features the same design as the lid, but the absence of a border offers a larger field for the image, to which slight compositional differences have been introduced—a bud that is closed where its counterpart on the lid is open, for instance, and an insect that has now grown full wings.   On the dark brown inner surface of the cover—which does not appear to have been hinged to the case—a floral spray, painted in golden washes and stippling, is rendered coppery beneath an orange-red varnish. In contrast to the full-color images on the outer surfaces, this vignette has a nocturnal and spectral quality. Such emphasis on creating formal contrast between inner and outer surfaces despite their shared imagery had been a feature of bookbinding since the early Safavid period or before.   Ironically, the mirror case, however delightful, fosters melancholy and longing: while it fixes beauty as a miniature garden preserved from the destructive forces of nature and gives visual form to the eternal dimension of love and desire, the repeated use of the mirror within it only underscores the transience of physical loveliness. Its opposing temporal dimensions, eternal and transient, are hinted at in the contrasting designs of the outer and inner cover. In this way, the mirror case carries a message comparable to that of the poetic ghazal, in which the thorn of the rose “provides a symbol of the unpleasant fact of mortality” and directs the beholder to focus on “the pursuit of true riches, stored in the heart and incorruptible.”[3]   David J. Roxburgh   [1] This mirror case was recently restored with a thick coating of varnish that was spray applied, according to Narayan Khandekar, Senior Conservation Scientist, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies, Harvard Art Museums.

Here the bulbul appears among flowers—roses and hydrangeas—against a reddish-brown ground enclosed by a ruled border. At the top right, above the hydrangeas, a small inscription in white nastaʿ līq reads yā Imām Ḥasan (O Imam Hasan), invoking the second Shiʿi Imam, son of ʿAli ibn Abi Talib and Fatima. The presence of this text suggests that a related theme, such as a devotional image of ʿAli and his sons Hasan and Husayn, will be found on the inner surface of the lid, so what actually appears there delivers a surprise: a grouping, derived from Christian sources, of a mother, her child, and an angel in a landscape setting. The Qajar rendition of this scene conflates the iconography of the Annunciation, where the angel Gabriel, bearing a lily, appears before the Virgin Mary, with that of Mary holding the infant Jesus, from whose head radiates a subtle halo. Although Mary’s red and blue clothing follows the standard color convention, she is dressed as a modern, bejeweled European lady. In a form of immodest modesty, the bodice of her dress is cut so low that it exposes her breasts, which are barely concealed by a diaphanous silky covering. The same gauzy fabric makes up her long but revealing sleeves.    The painting technique of this scene differs from that of the outer surface: here the underlying ivory-colored pasteboard is not completely covered with pigment. Rather, washes of bright paint dominated by red, blue, green, and gold, as well as extremely fine stippling, are applied to the paper, producing an effect that resembles ceramic glazing. The tinted monochrome palette of the landscape is typical of Qajar lacquer objects that, in adopting subject matter from European prints, mimic the effects of engraving.   The treatment of Mary’s bosom is reminiscent of the fusion of profane and Christian subjects developed in Mughal painting during the reign of Akbar (1556–1605) and fostered by his son and successor Jahangir (r. 1605–27).1 The eroticized image of the European woman, common in Qajar art, represents an appropriation of various European sources mediated through Indian artworks.[2]   David J.

A bird-and-flower composition uniting nightingale, rose, and blossoming branch dominates the center cartouche. The flanking compartments, one broadly mirroring the other save for changes in palette, contain prunus blossoms, a tulip, and hovering butterflies that gather nectar from and pollinate the plants. The background of the pen box is a deep reddish brown flecked with particles of gold; it provides the ideal contrast for the bright colors used in the bird-and-flower designs. The coloristic effect of the palette—greens, white, blues, pinks, browns, and reds—has been unified by the layers of shellac varnish applied to the surface as a final stage. The sides of the pen box continue the subject matter of the upper face, similarly structured in three compositional groupings; the principal difference is that the birds directly confront the winged insects amid miniature floral thickets.

148152,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"56   Haydar ʿAli Pen box with flowers, birds, and portraits Iran, Qajar period, dated 1290 (1873–74) Opaque and semi-opaque watercolor on prepared pasteboard under shellac varnish 4 × 21.7 × 3.3 cm (1 9/16 × 8 9/16 × 1 5/16 in.) 2002.50.110   Published: McWilliams 2004, 10, fig. 13.    On the dark brown upper surface of this pen case, European portrait roundels of a man and a woman are separated by three bird-and-flower vignettes. These unite different flora, with the rose predominating at the center, its branching stem inhabited by a solitary red-crested bird and insects fluttering around it. Haydar ʿAli’s signature, raqam-i Ḥaydar ʿAlī (work or design of Haydar ʿAli) and the date of production appear in miniature white script in the spaces between the central bird-and-flower grouping and the flanking portraits.[1] To add texture, the artist has used a technique combining wash and stippling in fine dots of pigment. The long sides of the pen case continue the bird-and-flower theme, expanding the botanical repertoire to include carnations, hazelnuts, and tulips. There are occasional, and presumably intentional, instances of visual ambiguity where what appear to be plants and flowers could be interpreted as insects.   The base is painted in a solid red pigment with an overlying elegant scroll of flowers and palmettes executed in gold. The outer body of the extractable drawer follows the pattern of the base, while its end, built up to be flush with the surface of the outer case when the drawer is closed, is decorated with daisies, poppies, and an iris. The unadorned inner surface of the case reveals the method of construction through many layers of paper glued one upon another. A single word, muḥkam (robust, strong), written at an indeterminate time, attests the physical integrity of the object.   Haydar ʿAli, son of Muhammad Ismaʿil, was active in the 1860s and 1870s and worked in the style of Najaf ʿAli. Several works signed by him are known.[2]   David J. Roxburgh   [1] In its most common usage, raqm (or raqam) means “writing” or “figuring,” but in this context “work” or “design” makes better sense. Earlier usages of the noun raqm or raqam, as well as the derivatives of the trilateral root m-sh-q, mashq (literally, specimen, exercise, model) and mashaqa (literally, to copy), suggest a conflation of the acts of writing and drawing and appear most frequently in the signatures of the Safavid artist Riza ʿAbbasi (c. 1560s–1635). For a catalogue of that artist’s works and signatures, see Canby 1996b, 179–200.

The same scheme appears on the sides, except that there the nudes are clearly female. The figures float through the air, suspended among the foliage, and grasp at the twisting stalks. On each of the three surfaces, scrolling gold acanthus leaves edged in dark brown intersect at the center to form a heart-shaped motif; this shape is more pronounced on the sides. A rose vine laden with blooms and a plant bearing smaller, pale blue flowers is interwoven with the gilded scrolls. The ground, a dark brownish black, offers the perfect contrast to the pale, luminescent torsos of the putti, the golden tone of the acanthus, and the green and pink of the rose vines. As in other examples of Persian lacquer, an application of tinted varnish—in this case not the original coating—warms the whole and has a unifying effect on the palette.    The brownish-black base and sliding drawer of the pen box are decorated with gold floral sprays, while the end of the drawer features two more putti. The paint on the sides of the exterior is considerably thinner than on the upper surface. In raking light it is possible to see pin-pricked outlines around the principal motifs, evidence of the use of a pounced design. Such designs, intended for transferring motifs and compositions from one medium to another, survive in albums of artists’ technical materials from the Qajar era.[2]   The painter’s signature appears in tiny white script on the upper surface of the pen case, to the right of center at the top edge. Lutf ʿAli (d. 1871–72) was one of several accomplished lacquer artists active in Shiraz in the middle years of the 1800s, although he may have spent part of his career in Isfahan or Tehran.[3]   David J. Roxburgh   [1] The heavy surface coating on this pen box is non-original and is not shellac (it did not match any library spectra), according to Narayan Khandekar, Senior Conservation Scientist, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies, Harvard Art Museums.

Densely packed cavalry troops flank groups of dueling warriors in the foreground, and a clustered mass of stationary cavalry stands at the farthest remove from the action. The expansive scope of the combat is conveyed by receding lines of cavalry stretching toward the horizon, resembling in effect the infinite reflections of a room of mirrors.   Without any clear direction of movement or indication of a dominant group that might leave the field victorious, the scene conveys the melee of battle as a series of skirmishes between individuals, some victorious over their foes, others less fortunate. Observing men falling from their horses and awaiting their final dispatch, the viewer’s eyes are drawn to the decapitated heads of victims who have already met death, an image that recalls the longstanding trope from Persian historical sources of battlefields littered with heads like balls on polo fields.   The sides and base of the pen box continue the theme of martial prowess, though here men mounted on horses and armed with swords, lances, and firearms hunt deer and a lion for sport. The artist unifies these compositionally varied scenes by setting them in developed landscapes of receding planes of grass and other vegetation, with horizons given over to trees and small buildings, each one different from the next, depicted in perspective.

147443,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"59   Figurine of a horse and rider Iran, probably Gilan, 12th–8th century BCE Bronze 2 × 2.3 × 0.8 cm (13/16 × 7/8 × 5/16 in.) 2002.50.100   During the Iron Age (c. 1450–500 BCE) bronze smiths in western Iran produced a wide array of tools, vessels, and personal ornaments with animal decor, as well as various animal figurines. The bronzes from Luristan are the best known, but animal figurines also come from the province of Gilan, on the southwestern shores of the Caspian Sea.   The delicate rendering of this minute bronze horse and rider from the Calderwood Collection captures all the essential details. The horse has a narrow midsection, short legs that taper to a point with no articulation of joints, and a tail that protrudes as a pointed stump. Ears, mane, and reins are indicated on its head. The rider sits far forward on the horse, forming a unit with its neck. His arms hold the reins; he has stubby legs and a prominent chin or nose.   Similar statuettes of horses with riders astride them can be found in a number of collections.[1] Their precise find spots are unknown, but like other bronzes, they tend to be labeled “Amlash,” after a small town in Gilan that served as a market for antiquities. A bronze horse or mule with a figure riding sidesaddle, another with just a saddle, and four horses without tack were excavated with other animal figurines from a rich Iron Age cemetery at the site of Marlik, in a fertile valley of the Elburz Mountains in Gilan.[2] Most of them larger but with similar stylistic features, the Marlik animal bronzes indicate that the Calderwood figurine was indeed made in the southwestern Caspian region, probably in the late second or early first millennium BCE. The animal figures from Marlik—including humped bulls, sometimes yoked to plows, as well as stags, goats, rams, dogs, boars, and felines—seem inspired by the natural and domestic environments of ancient Gilan. Placed in a tomb, they, like the horse and rider, would have represented for eternity the wealth and status of the deceased.   This diminutive statuette was cast solid and in one piece. It is covered in black patina with some pale green patches and a very thin layer of red copper oxide underneath.[3] Analysis has revealed that the metal contains between 2 and 2.5 percent of both tin and arsenic.[4] Arsenic has been found in Iranian copper-based artifacts made as early as the fifth millennium BCE; its presence was due at first to the use of polymetallic ores and later also to the addition of arsenic to the smelted copper. Early metalworkers appear to have been aware that arsenic—like the tin of a typical bronze—facilitated the casting, increased the hardness, and affected the color of copper-based objects.[5] In the case of the horse and rider, the desired quality of the metal seems to have been achieved by adding low percentages of tin and arsenic in combination.

Their impressions secured goods, and cylinder seals were rolled onto the still-malleable clay of tablets with cuneiform texts to guarantee their contents. By the period of Sasanian rule (224–642), which preceded the rise of Islam, cuneiform writing had long been abandoned, and documents written on parchment or other materials were sealed with bullae, or lumps of clay impressed with stamp seals. Sasanian seals include ring bezels as well as ellipsoid and dome-shaped stamps with string holes drilled through their sides. Carved of semiprecious stones and worn as rings or neck pendants, seals could also function as jewelry and amulets. Their intaglio designs preserve a rich corpus of Sasanian imagery, ranging from human busts and figures to animals to inanimate objects and monograms.[1]   The ellipsoid stamp seal of brown chalcedony from the Calderwood Collection (cat. 60) depicts a seated woman shown in profile, holding a flower close to her nose. Broad lines of diagonal hatching indicate the folds of her long garment; two horizontal lines suggest the seat. The line running parallel to the woman’s lower back might be the end of a braid. The sides of the seal are slightly chipped and the edges of the string hole worn. Women, often with braided hair, already appear on seals from the Achaemenid Persian empire of the sixth to fourth centuries BC, where they are shown serving wine, working wool, or enjoying the scent of a flower.[2] On Sasanian seals, women are usually shown standing, holding a flower or a large ring and sometimes accompanied by one or two children.[3] They have been interpreted as representing the fertility goddess Anahita or as depicting women from well-to-do families, their rings indicating their married status.[4] Female names inscribed on Sasanian seals attest that women as well as men owned seals.[5] It should not surprise us, then, that seals could bear their image.    The opaque gray chalcedony seal (cat. 61) is also ellipsoid but has a larger string hole and a leaf pattern carved on the back. It is engraved with a hand, a small crescent moon, and a hatched ribbon. The seal shows traces of wear, including surface abrasion around the image. Like the woman with flower, the raised hand was a popular device on Sasanian seals. It was usually rendered with thumb and forefinger touching, and occasionally holding a flower, in a gesture that could represent a greeting and was probably auspicious.[6] A small crescent moon occurs frequently on Sasanian seals and coins, often with a star.    Surviving Sasanian seals exhibit a number of carving styles. There are finely engraved examples with almost naturalistic-looking figures, and many—mostly smaller—specimens whose designs are even more linear than those of the Calderwood seals.[7]   Susanne Ebbinghaus   [1] See Bivar 1969; Brunner 1978; Azarpay and Zerneke 2002; Gyselen 2006.

146678,Published Catalogue Text,2013,In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,"62   Fineleaf Fumitory Folio from a manuscript of Khawāṣṣ al-ashjār (De materia medica) by Dioscorides Recto: text and illustration of rupturewort and an unidentified plant Verso: text and illustration of fineleaf fumitory Iraq, 13th century Ink and opaque watercolor on paper Folio: 29.7 × 20.2 cm (1111/16 × 7 15/16 in.) 2002.50.140   De materia medica, the great treatise on the therapeutic properties of natural substances—plants, minerals, and animals—was written, probably during the third quarter of the first century BCE, by Dioscorides Pedanius, a Greek author from Anzarba (now Anavarza), in southeastern Turkey.[1] Originally comprising some 1,007 chapters, the text was rearranged and supplemented over the centuries as it was translated into several languages and copied across Western Europe and the Middle East, where, until the end of the sixteenth century, it served as the basis for pharmaceutical and herbal writing. First translated into Arabic in the ninth century, Dioscorides’ treatise became one of the most frequently copied books in Islamic lands, laying a foundation for the further work of Muslim physicians, scientists, and pharmacists.   This folio probably once belonged to a now-fragmentary and dispersed manuscript known as the Vignier-Densmore Dioscorides.[2] Containing most of Book III of the treatise and parts of the remaining books, the known folios of this manuscript preserve neither colophon nor date. Characteristics of the Vignier-Densmore manuscript include the letter sīn written with three diacritical dots below it; fifteen to seventeen lines of text per page; the loss of, or damage to, the outer bottom corners of the folios; a purplish-black discoloration of the paper caused by the ink bleeding through from the opposite side; and Western-style numbering in the outer top corners.[3]   The stylized image follows the conventions of herbal illustration in depicting the plant from leaf tips to bare roots. The rubric qāfunūs identifies the plant as fineleaf fumitory (Fumaria parvifolia), which, according to the text, has small, grayish leaves and purple flowers; its sharp juice makes the eyes water and, when mixed with glue, can be used to discourage the growth of eyebrows. When eaten, the herb causes the patient to excrete bile.[4]   Mary McWilliams   [1] Titled Peri hylēs iatrikēs in the original Greek, Dioscorides’ treatise is best known in modern literature by the title of the sixth-century Latin translation, De materia medica (The Materials of Medicine). An introduction to the immense scholarly literature on Dioscorides can be found in the footnotes to Touwaide 2009, 557–80. [2] I am grateful to Alain Touwaide (Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions, Washington, DC) for identifying the Calderwood folio with the Vignier-Densmore Dioscorides. Touwaide is researching the history of this manuscript for future publication. See also Sadek 1983, 18; Grube 1959, 179–80, fig. 18. According to Sadek and Grube, the bulk of the manuscript was formerly on loan to the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris (collection particulière). Whatever the case, folios of the manuscript are now in several collections across the world. Grube lists additional bibliography for some of the dispersed folios. [3] The following thirteen folios appear to be dispersed from the same manuscript: Aga Khan Collection, Toronto (five folios, A.M. 2/A–E); Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (two folios, 65.271.1, 65.271.2); private collection, Princeton; University of Michigan Museum of Art, Ann Arbor (1957/2.1); Walters Art Museum, Baltimore (Ms. W 750, four consecutive folios).

As related in Firdawsi’s Shāhnāma, the mighty Isfandiyar, son of King Gushtasp, led the Iranian army to victory against the Turanians, commanded by Gurgsar. The fight between the two champions ended when Isfandiyar lassoed Gurgsar and pulled him to the ground. In its figural style, treatment of ground line, and restricted space, this fourteenth-century painting recalls the aesthetic conventions of Iranian mīnāʾī and luster ceramics (see, for instance, cats. 27 and 30). The figures are arrayed symmetrically in a frieze, and loosely drawn foliage fills the background. This folio was part of a now-dispersed illustrated Shāhnāma commissioned in 1341 by the vizier of the Inju governor in Fars.[1]   Mika M. Natif   [1] According to M. S. Simpson 2000, 241.

Named “The Enthroned One” (dhāt al-kursī) in Arabic, this constellation of the Northern Hemisphere was pictured in antiquity as the beautiful, but tragically vain, Queen Cassiopeia of Greek mythology.   The painting was part of a now-dispersed manuscript of al-Sufi’s Book of the Fixed Stars, a tenth-century astronomical manual that expanded and updated Ptolemy’s Almagest, integrating it with the rich star lore and nomenclature of the Anwāʿ, the pre-Islamic Arabic tradition.[1] For each of the forty-eight constellations, al-Sufi provided a description, a star chart, and two images, the first as seen on a celestial globe and the second as it  appeared in the heavens.    The rubric above her states that the queen in this painting represents the constellation as viewed on a celestial globe. She wears a Persian crown topped by a fluttering plume, rather than the diadem of classical precedent.[2] Although rendered in awkward perspective, the Western-style throne on which she perches adheres more closely to classical sources than does her crown, allowing the figure to sit “with her feet outstretched,” as the text requires.   This painting and six others that can be associated with it suggest that the manuscript from which they were removed emphasized aesthetic over scientific aims.[3] Whereas illustrations in astronomical texts are usually line drawings with, at most, translucent touches of color, these paintings employ the opaque pigments preferred for illustrating poetic narratives. More telling, perhaps, is the fact that none of the stars are labeled.   Examined against transmitted light, this folio is revealed to be composed of two sheets of paper. The image of Cassiopeia is painted on a fragmentary sheet that has been pasted onto a larger text folio. It appears that there is a star chart on the reverse of the fragmentary sheet.[4]   Mary McWilliams   [1] Arguably the most popular classical text on astronomy, Mathēmatikē syntaxis was compiled about 150 in Alexandria by the Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy. This mathematical and astronomical work is best known in English as the Almagest, a corruption of the word megistē (the greatest) as it appeared in Arabic translation (al-majisṭī). The Almagest was first translated into Arabic in the early ninth century; Al-Sufi (903–986) retranslated and expanded it around the year 964 for Adud al-Dawla, ruler of the Iranian Buyyid dynasty. Translated into Persian, Latin, and Spanish, Book of the Fixed Stars exerted considerable influence well into the seventeenth century. [2] When this painting came to the Harvard Art Museums, Cassiopeia’s face was markedly darkened due to discoloration by the lead white component of the pigment. By using hydrogen peroxide, Sara Bisi, Craigen W. Bowen Fellow in the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies from 2010 to 2011, was able to lighten the face significantly, though a slightly dark cast remains. [3] In order of their probable appearance in the manuscript, these folios depict the following constellations: Perseus (David Collection, Copenhagen, 37/2006); Serpentarius and Ophiuchus (Harvard Art Museums, 1919.131); Andromeda and Pisces (Aga Khan Museum, Toronto, AKM00043); Gemini (David Collection, Copenhagen, 4/2000); Sagittarius the Archer (Nelson-Atkins Gallery of Art, Kansas City, 35-30/1); and Capricornus the Kid Nelson-Atkins, 35-30/5). With the exception of Sagittarius in the Nelson-Atkins Gallery, which appears to have been cut down, these folios all measure approximately 21.5 × 14.5 cm. Red double-line rulings enclose images and diagrams. The rubrics are written in a rounded naskh in red or black ink; the text, in black ink, is in a distinctive and that features the letters wāw and terminal yāʾ written as straight lines slanting in the Z-direction. [4] The fragmentary sheet measures approximately 19.3 × 11.6 cm (7 5⁄8 × 4 9⁄16 in.) and is slightly darker in color than the larger text folio on which it is pasted. The painting is also marred by a pair of brownish feet appearing in Cassiopeia’s lap; these are probably a chemical alteration to her yellow robe caused by a painting that had been on a facing page. The feet depicted on the facing page may have been painted with a copper green pigment (as are the feet of Cassiopeia); this pigment often discolors areas with which it is in direct contact. For these observations, we are grateful to Penley Knipe, Philip and Lynn Straus Conservator of Works of Art on Paper, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies.",NULL,NULL

Queen Qaydafa was the ruler of Andalusia. She was wise, just, prosperous, and admired by her subjects. Upon hearing of the victories and success of Iskandar (Alexander the Great), she ordered her painter to gain surreptitious access to the eminent king, study him carefully, and produce a detailed, full-length portrait of him, to supplement the portraits of great rulers she already possessed. Following his conquests in the east, Iskandar sent Qaydafa a letter demanding her immediate and unconditional submission, which she refused. When Iskandar, disguised as his own messenger, appeared at her court, the queen recognized him and countered his denials of his royal identity with the portrait made by her artist. After the two conversed and recognized their mutual wisdom and talents, Iskandar returned to his land with gifts, having learned an invaluable lesson.   The illustration captures the moment when Iskandar, shown sitting on a golden seat in front of Qaydafa, sees his portrait. Even though the text calls for him to be in disguise as a messenger, he wears a crown like the one in the painting he is examining. The queen, in a golden diadem, gestures toward Iskandar from her large throne. The protagonists are surrounded by the queen’s female retinue, who peek at the painting and talk to one another. Although, according to the text, the episode takes place at the Andalusian court, the illustration has transformed the setting into a fifteenth-century Iranian or Central Asian palace.   Mika M.

She offered to water his horses, but Shapur refused her help, saying that his men could perform the task. As they struggled to bring up the heavy bucket, the prince asked the woman about her family. When he learned that she was the daughter of his enemy Mihrak Nushzad and had been brought to the village for safekeeping, he decided to marry her immediately.

Invited to join Anushirvan’s court after interpreting a dream of the king, the young Buzurgmihr became a trusted royal vizier, famous for his intelligence and wisdom. When an Indian envoy brought the game of chess to court to test the Iranians’ intelligence, it was Buzurgmihr who solved the mystery of how to play the game and in response invented backgammon.

The scene shows the young ruler on a throne in an open garden, surrounded by his retinue. Three high-ranking officials are seated on a carpet at the left, while two others stand behind them. The king’s sword bearer and falconer are depicted on the right, and servants and musicians appear in the foreground. This illustration reflects the standard iconography of Central Asian and Persian audience scenes or official celebrations.

Shiruy, although distressed by the idea, was too weak to stand up to his nobles; they hired an assassin, whom Firdawsi describes as a hideous man named Mihr Hurmuzd. When Mihr Hurmuzd entered the palace where Khusraw Parviz was imprisoned, the king was appalled by the repellent creature who would bring about his death. He ordered his servant to bring fresh clothes and water and, after washing and praying, put on the clothes and covered his face with a cloak to avoid seeing his ugly murderer. Immediately Mihr Hurmuzd, dagger in hand, locked the chamber doors and stabbed the king in the chest.   The painting captures the dramatic climax of the story, showing Khusraw on his bed and, atop him, Mihr Hurmuzd in the act of stabbing. Khusraw wears a crown; his face, contrary to what the text says, is not covered. The appearance of the assassin likewise diverges from the textual description: he wears ordinary fifteenth-century court dress, and only his exposed legs indicate his lowly status. The royal chamber in which the scene takes place is decorated with wall paintings, tilework, a carpet, and various types of geometric ornament.   Mika M. Natif",NULL,NULL

He met his end at the behest of the governor of Merv, Mahuy Suri, who learned that the fugitive king had taken refuge in a mill and ordered the miller to execute him. Firdawsi narrates in great detail the shah’s tragic death and laments the extinction of the dynasty, underscoring the treachery and greed of Mahuy and his unworthiness to wear the Iranian crown.   The painting shows the miller as he approaches the king —“as if,” in Firdawsi’s words, “to whisper a secret in his ear”—and then stabs him with a dagger. Yazdigird wears colorful, gold-ornamented clothing and a crown, in contrast to the plain brown dress of the miller.

In this part of Firdawsi’s epic, the Iranian king Kay Kavus decided to wage war against Turan (Turkestan), even though his son, prince Siyavush, had signed a treaty with the Turanian king, Afrasiyab. Siyavush chose to disregard his father’s orders and accept Afrasiyab’s invitation to visit Turan and take refuge in the realm, thereby averting yet another war between Iran and Turan.    This folio was part of a famous illustrated manuscript of the Shāhnāma produced at the Safavid court during the 1520s and 1530s. Known as the Shāhnāma of Shah Tahmasp, after the ruler (r. 1524–76) for whom it was made, the book originally consisted of 759 text folios and 258 paintings of superb quality.[1] This illustration portrays a moment of optimism and brotherhood between the Turanians and the Iranians. Having dismounted from their horses, Afrasiyab and Siyavush embrace, to the delight of their attendants and supporters. Piran, Afrasiyab’s aged advisor, who has played an important role in fostering a relationship of trust between the former foes, stands on the left, a white-bearded figure witnessing the exchange of affection. The emotional scene takes place in front of a colorfully decorated palatial structure that likely reflects contemporary Safavid architecture. The headgear of all the figures, Iranians and Turanians alike, consists of turbans folded around caps with tall red projections (tāj-I Ḥaydarī). These distinctive turbans were worn by the followers of Tahmasp and suggest a sense of identification with the Shāhnāma at the Safavid court.   Mika M.

The Haft paykar (Seven Beauties, or Seven Portraits) is a romantic epic poem of about 5130 couplets that narrates the life of the Sasanian king Bahram Gur. A substantial section of the poem relates how Bahram Gur discovered portraits of princesses from the seven climes, fell in love with these beauties, searched them out, and wed them all. For his brides he had an architect construct seven domed pavilions with colors corresponding to the seven climes and the planets that ruled them. On each day of the week, the king visited one princess, who would tell him a story in keeping with her color and mood.   This painting depicts Bahram Gur’s visit on Saturday to the Indian princess, who occupies a black pavilion (governed by Saturn). The king and his bride, wearing black and dark gray robes patterned in gold, sit in a black-domed palatial structure, drinking wine as female servants and entertainers attend them. The illuminated text boxes are embedded in the palace architecture, becoming part of the densely ornamental painted surface. As is typical of these illustrations, the color of the protagonists’ clothing matches that of the architecture around them.   Mika M. Natif",NULL,NULL

Nizami’s romance Khusraw va Shīrīn involves historical figures of pre-Islamic Iran, principally the Sasanian king Khusraw II Parviz (r. 590–628) and the Armenian princess Shirin. Young Prince Khusraw, enticed by his friend Shapur’s description of a beautiful and virtuous princess he had seen in Armenia, sent Shapur off to find her and bring her to Iran. Shapur, a skilled artist, drew a series of portraits of Khusraw, and, upon viewing them, Shirin fell in love with the handsome prince and set out for his kingdom, while Khusraw himself left Iran to seek the princess in Armenia. Following a series of failed encounters, the couple met, but their marriage was postponed for many years by a series of obstacles.    In this painting the soon-to-be newlyweds are shown seated in a lavishly decorated architectural setting with male courtiers or sages and female attendants. The illuminated text boxes form part of the palace structure, contributing to the elaboration of the pictorial surface. Four maidens stand on the tiled roof, and two more are seated on a balcony. In the main hall, where the wedding reception will take place, the figures gesture in animated conversation. Several trays of pomegranates—symbolic of love, sexuality, and procreation—are placed on the carpet beside the guests.   Mika M. Natif",NULL,NULL

The story of the miraculous night journey of the Prophet Muhammad is based on passages from the Qurʾan (17:1, 53:1–18, and 81:19–25), as well as later hadith that describe his travel (isrāʾ ) from “the holy mosque” to “the farthest mosque” as well as his ascent to heaven (miʿrāj) and what he experienced there. Paintings of this wondrous event sometimes appear in illustrated manuscripts of Persian epic and romantic poetry, such as the Khamsa of Nizami, even though they are not directly related to the stories told in these works.    In this illustration, the Prophet is shown in mid-journey, riding his human-headed steed, Buraq. Rainbow-winged angels hover around him and proffer golden vessels. Among them is Archangel Gabriel: holding a banner of green, the color associated with the Prophet, he leads Muhammad on his mystical journey. Although earlier depictions of the Prophet reveal his face, here he is shown veiled, in accord with iconography adopted at the beginning of the Safavid period, in the early 1500s.[1]   Mika M.

After arriving at the Indian court, however, Burzuy came to understand that it was not a magical plant but rather a book called Kalila and Dimna that contained the transformative wisdom he sought. Forbidden to take notes as he read, he memorized parts of the book by day and transcribed them secretly by night, sending his transcriptions back to Anushirvan. Upon his return to Iran, Burzuy was received with great honor at the court. Free to choose his reward, he asked that the story of his adventure be included as a preface in the vizier Buzurgmihr’s translation into Pahlavi (Middle Persian) of the Kalila and Dimna.   This painting, of a seemingly generic reception scene at the Safavid court, focuses only subtly on the story of  Burzuy. King Anushirvan is shown seated on his throne, surrounded by attendants and officials; courtiers engage in animated conversations and women watch from their apartments. At center left, however, a young man is busy writing: he probably represents Buzurgmihr, Anushirvan’s brilliant vizier, who is copying either the text of Kalila and Dimna or Burzuy’s story. Burzuy is likely the bearded man sitting opposite him on the right.

When Khusraw returned to Iran with reinforcements from the Byzantine emperor, Bahram gathered his army and prepared to do battle against him. One brave Byzantine, Kut of Rum, volunteered to ride to Bahram’s camp and challenge him to single combat. Khusraw and the rest of his men watched the ensuing contest from a mountaintop.

When his father refused to abdicate in his favor, the impatient young prince left Iran for the capital city of Rum (Constantinople). There the emperor’s eldest daughter fell in love with him despite his guise of a lowly workman; having been promised her choice of a husband, she married him against her father’s wishes. The emperor then decreed that only men of tested valor could marry his two younger daughters. The daughters’ suitors both sought Gushtasp’s help with their assigned feats; secretly taking their places, the prince killed two fearsome monsters.   In this image, Gushtasp acts on behalf of Ahran, the suitor of the youngest daughter, in slaying a terrifying dragon.

Rustam had departed the kingdom of his bride, Tahmina, before Sohrab’s birth. He was unaware of his son’s existence until they met, years later, on the battlefield, where Sohrab was leading the Turanian army against the Iranians. Not recognizing each other, the two champions fought in fierce single combat on three successive days. Only after Rustam managed to wrestle Sohrab to the ground and fatally stab him was the identity of the mighty young warrior revealed to his distraught father.    The painting on the right depicts Rustam kneeling next to his dying son, who lies mortally wounded. Sohrab’s coat has been partially pulled off to reveal on his arm the amulet that Rustam gave Tahmina the night Sohrab was conceived. Warriors of the two armies, looking on in shock, encircle the two heroes. The painting on the left shows Rustam singlehandedly carrying the coffin of his son.

At left the two traitorous officers, Mahiyar and Janusiyar, are shown bound, with their heads shaved; Iskandar has assured Dara that he will have them executed. Encircling the death scene are the mournful and bewildered entourages of the two rulers. These military men are depicted not only in the usual profile and three-quarter views but also frontally and from behind. Although Dara is the elder brother, in this painting it is the lamenting Iskandar who has the white beard.   The tragic scene takes place against a colorful background painted in light blue, mauve, and ochre; the flowers, grass, rocks, and trees of the landscape offset the grimness of the human drama. Figures and landscape have both been delineated in exceptional detail.   Mika M. Natif",NULL,NULL

Crossing the border to see the fair maidens of Turan encamped at a spring festival, Bizhan encountered Manizha, and the two were so powerfully attracted to each other that they trysted in her tent for three days. When Afrasiyab learned of the affair, he arrested Bizhan and imprisoned him in a dark pit covered by a heavy stone, with only the dishonored Manizha to keep him alive. Eventually, Bizhan was saved by the Iranian hero Rustam, who was the only one strong enough to remove the stone from the mouth of the pit.   The painting shows the moment of rescue. Rustam, dressed in his tiger-skin coat, has cast away the stone and with a rope pulls the chained, half-naked Bizhan up from the       depths. On the left stands Manizha, in white robe and veil. Encircling the main scene, a crowd of admiring soldiers witnesses the rescue mission.   Mika M. Natif",NULL,NULL

Entering the Land of Darkness, the king asked a local leader and mystic, Khizr, to be their guide, but, taking a wrong turn, they became separated from him and had to continue on their own in the gloom. Alone, Khizr found the magical spring, whose waters he bathed in and drank. Meanwhile, Iskandar came to a mountain; at its summit was Israfil, the Angel of Death, holding a trumpet and awaiting God’s orders to blow it. Upon seeing Iskandar, the angel warned him to be less concerned for crown and throne, since the ruler himself would someday hear the trumpet call.   The painting depicts three separate occurrences in the story. An enormous Israfil, holding a seven-belled horn, dominates the upper left corner of the composition, dwarfing Iskandar, with whom the angel converses. Behind and below Iskandar, members of his army struggle through the rocky landscape, their torches lighting the winding route; they turn to one another and gesture with their hands, enlivening the composition. In the lower left corner, Khizr and a second man, Ilyas, have found the Water of Life. According to tradition, these two prophets never died; hence they are shown drinking from the spring of immortality while all others seek their way in the dark.   Mika M. Natif",NULL,NULL

This folio is half of what was a double-page frontispiece depicting King Solomon on the right and Bilqis, the Queen of Sheba, on the left.[1] The Calderwood painting represents Solomon and his court, including his vizier Asaf, surrounded by animals, birds, angels, and divs. This scene is not linked to the text of the Shāhnāma per se, but rather reflects concepts of the ideal ruler. Similar depictions of Solomon appear as frontispieces in many Safavid illustrated manuscripts, merging the image of the just king with that of a prophet who is close to God.   The rich detail, bright colors, and lively composition of this frontispiece would have made it visually suitable for introducing the kingly adventures narrated and depicted in the following pages of the manuscript.  The painting is surrounded by a wide band of illumination, in blue and gold with delicate floral tracery.   Mika M.

While shaving the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid (d. 809) in the bathhouse, a barber impertinently professed his love for the ruler’s daughter and asked to marry her. Astounded at the barber’s audacity, the caliph consulted his vizier, who speculated that the barber might have been standing atop a treasure, which would generate inordinate confidence in any man. The next day, the vizier suggested, the caliph should choose another spot in the bathhouse and observe the barber’s behavior. Standing in a different place to minister to the caliph, the barber behaved in a polite and appropriate manner, not mentioning the ruler’s daughter. Harun al-Rashid immediately ordered the original location excavated, and indeed a treasure was found there.   The illustration represents a lively genre scene of men in a bathhouse being washed, massaged, shaved, and entertained. Depicted at the right of the main chamber are a seated man, his lower body draped in blue, and a standing man in red who shaves his head. These two probably represent the caliph and the barber.

This episode of Nizami’s poem tells of an old woman who complained to the Seljuk ruler Sultan Sanjar (d. 1157) about the harsh treatment that she had received from his police. After recounting the physical and mental suffering inflicted on her by Sanjar’s men, she proceeded to describe the immoral conduct of the ruler himself and the disapproval of his subjects throughout the empire, warning him that his tyranny and lack of justice would lead to his demise.

In the tragic romance between Layla and Qays (later known as majnūn—“mad” or “possessed”), the two met and fell in love as schoolchildren. Layla’s father rejected Qays’s marriage proposal and separated the pair, and, on his orders, Layla married another man. Majnun, suffering the pain of unfulfilled love, felt that he could no longer be part of human society and became a recluse in the desert wilderness, living among the animals, who accepted his behavior and understood his agony. Although married, Layla remained faithful to Majnun and confined herself to writing poetry. In the tragic conclusion to the story, Majnun died on his beloved’s grave.    The artist of this painting has illustrated an episode in which Majnun’s maternal uncle, Shaykh Salim, visits the love-stricken man in the desert and pleads with him to return to his former life and family. Majnun is shown half naked, a piece of blue cloth tied around his waist, embracing and talking to a deer. Salim, fully clothed in a long brown coat and a white turban, gestures to his nephew. The landscape setting represents a desert oasis with a stream, trees, grass, and flowers. Majnun and Salim are surrounded by animals, most of them in pairs whose members interact with each other, reinforcing the viewer’s impression of Majnun’s lonely solitude.   Mika M. Natif",NULL,NULL

Specializing in thuluth and naskh scripts, İsmaʿil received his calligraphic education and license from Ressam Ömer Efendi.[2] He signed his name İsmaʿil Muhasib, since after his training at the court school he was sent to the provinces as a bookkeeper (muhasib) of the court eunuchs. He copied a Qurʾan on the order of Ahmed III (r. 1703–30) and was generously rewarded. His surviving work consists of individual calligraphic specimens and others contained in albums (muraqqaʿ ).[3]   Originally, the hilye text was simply written on paper and carried as a protective amulet. In the last quarter of the seventeenth century, the renowned calligrapher Hafız Osman transformed it into a circular calligraphic composition and included it in a copy of al-An ʿām, the sixth chapter of the Qurʾan. With representational images of, for instance, Mecca and Medina, hilyes began to be included in various prayer books that contained Qurʾanic chapters and prayers.[4] Believed to bring succor in times of difficulty, such prayer books had widespread public appeal.[5] Hilyes created as independent calligraphic compositions became very popular in Ottoman lands during the nineteenth century, and large-format examples were often hung on the walls of Ottoman houses.

These forms are delineated in ink on the dark ivory paper, and additional definition is provided by traces of black chalk and by shading and line in graphite, probably added with a pencil.   The principal contours of the design have been pricked with a pin. Given the absence of traces of pouncing chalk on the drawing itself, it is likely that a transparent sheet of paper was laid over it and that the pin was used to make holes in the upper sheet, along the design contours. The pricked sheet of transparent paper was then laid on another sheet of paper and a pounce bag full of powdered chalk or charcoal tapped over it. When the transparent sheet was removed, particles of chalk or charcoal remained on the paper beneath and served as a guide for drawing the lines in a permanent medium, thus accomplishing the transfer of the original design.   After serving its preliminary purpose, this drawing was mounted on an album page assembled from strips of colored papers and fragments of Persian poetry.   David J.

In some instances, these items had originally been created for manuscripts; in other cases, they had been made as models or as autonomous works of art.   The subject of the recumbent lioness is known from a corpus of drawings and paintings executed during the late Timurid and Safavid periods. With slight variations, these artworks depict the lioness in a pose of relaxation, tethered by a chain attached to a belled collar.[2] The drawings share a technique that uses stippling or short lines (without hatching) to convey the contours and mass of the lioness as well as the texture of her coat. In this example, fine lines and dots of reddish brown, black, and white have been applied over the ivory-colored paper. Around the muzzle, ear tips, belly, and rump, white opaque watercolor is introduced, contrasting with the lines and dots and lending the drawing greater depth. The lioness’s eyes, collar, and chain are accented with gold.   Now mounted on a sheet of modern paper, the drawing lacks any trace of a signature or attribution, but it can be linked through a sequence of closely related works to a prototype originated by the renowned artist Kamal al-Din Bihzad (d. 1535–36). Two extant examples carry credible attributions to Bizhad, and more are either ascribed to him or signed by other artists, such as Murad or Shah Muhammad Isfahani.[3] Judging by the number of imitative responses, the recumbent lioness was one of Bihzad’s most appreciated artworks, whose resonance endured into the seventeenth century.[4]   David J.

Differences in their age and stature are conveyed principally through hair: the older man has an impressive mustache, whereas the younger man’s face is bare, and a boyish ringlet falls from his turban. Both men wear relatively simple robes cinched at the waist with wide sashes; their turbans are large, with complicated pleating and draping. Some passages of the drawing are tinted in pale washes of yellow, green, and white watercolor to set them off from the background of the ivory paper sheet. Surrounding the drawing is a complex border consisting of ruled lines of gold and other colors, a band of yellow paper, and an outer margin dominated by a floral pattern executed in two tones of gold over a pinkish-yellow ground. The theme of male affection occurs in many single-sheet studies from the Safavid period.[1]   David J. Roxburgh   [1] A good comparative example is in the Freer and Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC (F1954.28).",NULL,NULL

The composition of this portrait study was first outlined in pencil and then blocked out with fields of watercolor, as is evidenced in the sitter’s chair. Next, the artist added opaque watercolor in layers, using fine lines and stippling to replicate the designs and textures of fabrics, most prominently those of the young man’s patterned coat and its gray fur trim. In contrast to his brightly colored clothing, his face is generally pallid, but blues beneath his chin and mouth suggest the hint of a beard. The play on near monochrome is continued in the silhouetted, inky locks that frame his face and give way to a tall black hat. The subject’s position in the composition and aspects of painterly execution such as the modeling of his face and hands suggest that the image was based at least in part on a photograph, a practice common among Qajar artists from the mid-nineteenth century onward, photography having been introduced in Iran in the 1840s.   The painting reflects the “new realism” introduced by Abuʾl-Hasan Ghaffari, also known as Saniʿ al-Mulk, in the middle years of the nineteenth century, during the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah (r. 1848–96), and disseminated by his contemporaries. Ghaffari’s work combined physiognomic likeness with the psychology of the subject to produce an often intense pictorial effect—a “real” presence—undiminished by rich decorative details, which in some artists’ hands might emphasize surface at the expense of illusionistic volume and depth.[1] Although this portrait lacks the overall impact of a work by Ghaffari, it demonstrates its painter’s participation in what was new at the time.    On the lower right side of the sheet, a barely visible inscription, which reads, taṣvīr-i  dukhtar-i Shāhrukh (depiction [by] the daughter of Shahrukh), is tantalizing because it suggests a female artist. Unfortunately, however, this notation is too perfunctory and too uncertain in date to permit further conclusions.    David J. Roxburgh   [1] See Raby 1999, 56 and cats. 119–21.

C. Welch 2000, 322, fig. 1.   This self-assured drawing depicts a detailed landscape occupied by three figures: an old man and a princely figure facing each other at the center, and a youth watching them from behind a low hillock. The older figure—a man of learning and possibly an advisor—adopts a deferential pose, with his turbaned head tilted forward and down and his hands withdrawn into the long sleeves of his robe as a sign of respect. The princely man, who, as his beard indicates, has reached maturity, looks directly at his companion and gestures with both arms. His turban is elegantly wrapped, the cloth gathered in artful folds around a Safavid baton (tāj-i Ḥaydarī); he wears a ring on his left hand, carries a small bound book tucked inside his shirt, and holds a rounded object—a cushion, book, or container—between his arm and torso. The visual language of the poses suggests that he is inviting the older man to converse.   The landscape conjures a hospitable setting for this subtle human interaction. The tree around which the two figures stand offers shelter to songbirds; from its roots flow a branching rivulet edged with rocks and flowering plants. Above the high horizon, the sky is full of clouds. The artist, who has been identified as Mirza ʿAli,[1] has carefully modulated his use of line—whether uniform or varying in thickness—throughout the drawing. The hierarchy of thick and thin is logical: the figures and landscape elements are positioned in their respective spaces by firm delineation, while their individuality is defined by thinner lines or occasional washes that supply the details.   An attribution at the lower edge of the drawing could be read as the name Manuchihr.   David J. Roxburgh   [1] By Stuart Cary Welch: see S. C. Welch 2000. Mirza ʿAli was the son of Sultan Muhammad, one of the most important artists working for Safavid patrons in the formative period of Safavid art.

The drawing itself, executed in black ink using line and wash, depicts an elderly man traversing a landscape of rocky outcroppings, scattered boulders, and plants. Hunched forward, he uses a cane to prop himself up and navigate the uneven terrain. The draftsmanship is accomplished overall, but the rendering of the old man’s expressive facial features and the detail of his ear pressed under the weight of a fat turban are especially fine.    An inscription at the bottom reads, ʿamal-i kamīna Riżā-yi ʿAbbāsī (work of/done by the humble Riza ʿAbbasi). Because the vast majority of Riza’s signatures begin with raqm or raqam (design) or mashaqahu (drew it), this inscription is likely to be an attribution. Moreover, the manner in which it is written differs from authentic specimens of Riza’s handwriting. While certain details of the drawing might mimic Riza’s work, it is not by him,  or does it directly copy one of his known studies.   The intent of the attribution is difficult to judge: it could be an approving assertion that this work is equivalent in quality to works by Riza or, alternatively, a knowingly false claim of Riza’s direct authorship. The verso of the album folio features a calligraphic specimen mounted within a blue border decorated with gold palmettes, rosettes, and leaves. The calligraphy, copied  in black nastaʿ līq on brown paper, consists of two couplets of Persian poetry and is signed by Khalil Allah. A line of minute script between the couplets notes that the “writing occurred” (taḥrīr yāft) in the “abode of the sultanate Herat” (bi-dār al-sulṭāna Harāt).   David J. Roxburgh",NULL,NULL

The woman’s facial features, which include rounded cheeks, arched eyebrows, and a beauty spot, accord with contemporary standards of female comeliness. She is outfitted in elegant clothes, which emphasize her broad hips and slim torso, and a graceful headdress decorated with feathers. Wisps of curly hair frame her face and blow in the wind. The long, tapered strokes that delineate the profile of her hips and right shoulder seem to vibrate; the horizontal undulation of her hair indicates movement; and the staccato lines used to define the fluttering fabric of her skirt and the clouds in the sky above further increase the sense of animation. The drawing, which in several details reflects the style of Riza ʿAbbasi (see cat. 122), has been attributed to Habib Allah Savaji, an artist who was invited to work for the future ruler Shah ʿAbbas (r. 1587–1629) in Herat and then Isfahan. Habib Allah’s oeuvre includes drawings, single-page paintings, and manuscript illustrations.[1]   Framing the drawing is a decorated border, drawn in gold on ivory paper. Layers of pink wash have been applied to the figures, which include Chinese phoenixes and qilins assimilated into Persianate art since the early 1400s, a vase with flowers, and landscape and floral elements. A series of colored ruled lines separates drawing from border.   David J.

A youthful dervish, his clothing rendered in uniformly dark hues of cool green, purple, and brown that contrast with the warm pink of his face and hands, is posed against a ground of ivory-colored paper, unpainted save for a common repertoire of golden landscape elements. He wears a plumed wool cap, carries a staff over his shoulder, and offers a sprig of yellow, red, and gray leaves to a companion beyond the picture frame.[1] An inscription that reads, raqm/ raqam-i kamīna Riżā-yi ʿAbbāsī (work of the humble Riza ʿAbbasi)—the customary wording of the artist’s signed works—appears at the lower left. Although raqm or raqam ordinarily means “writing” or “figuring,” here it makes more sense translated as “work” or “design.” Riza’s frequent use of this term in his signatures suggests a conceptual blurring of the boundaries between the arts of writing and of depicting and, in addition, may represent a claim of entitlement to the high status accorded to calligraphers.

Gold also highlights robe lapels and buttons, trouser hems, turban trim, and the accoutrements of wine drinking—a small cup and a tall-necked ewer. The lining of the woman’s robe is filled in with blue; used together with white, this pigment defines the bowl behind the ewer as a blue-and-white ceramic (likely Iranian-made imitation porcelain).   The primary subject of the drawing is one of intimate, private bliss: a man lovingly embraces a woman, hugging her around the waist and lifting her from the ground, while she in turn snatches the turban from his head and carelessly upends her wine cup.    Despite its individualized charm, this depiction of a loving couple represents a fairly common type.[1] It shares with other drawings of the period, also classifiable by their human subjects,2 key elements of artistic execution—sinuous, carefully weighted contour outlines, “check marks” terminating knotted and bunched textiles,  and fine stippling applied only to faces and hair—each element showing the artist’s fluency in a particular drafting technique.

This drawing is one of several examples that take members of the Safavid court into the country, here a landscape divided into two parts by the meandering profile of a craggy brown rock. Emphasized by its deep blue color, a pool of water, or perhaps a mountain brook, is set near the center of the composition; behind it is a smaller rock, tinted pale blue as if cooled by the adjacent water. Two trees, one with birds perched in its branches, grow from the main rock; they are defined by delicate line drawing in black ink, augmented by the selective use of gray and red washes. Two men flank the pool: one, with a youthful, trim physique, can be identified as a Safavid prince or ruler. Facing him is an older, bearded, heavy-set man—most likely a guardian and instructor (lālā)—who, unlike the royal figure, has a sword and dagger attached to his belt. In their hands, the prince and guardian hold thin objects, depicted with attenuated, taut lines and at first sight suggesting walking sticks or canes. But these objects extend into the water.    Although scenes of game hunting with sword, spear, and bow-and-arrow abound in Persianate paintings and drawings, and although references to this sport dominate the written sources, fishing was also practiced and enjoyed by the Safavid elite.[1] The historian Khvandamir mentions the youthful predilection for fishing of Shah Ismaʿil (r. 1501–24) and identifies the River Talvar—near Maragha and the  meadows of Surluq—as a preferred site.[2] The Venetian envoy Michele Membré recounts the details of a fishing excursion by Shah Ismaʿil’s son and successor, Shah Tahmasp (r. 1524–76), to the “pools of sweet water” in the mountains near Maragha. Membré describes Tahmasp’s attire, fishing tackle (thin canes with hooks), and how the catch of the day was collected and divided;[3] the ruler seems to have spent the entire month of October 1539 in this pursuit. Tahmasp himself also mentions fishing, which he terms “fish-hunting” (shikār-i māhī), in his memoirs.[4]   Another figure in the composition is an attendant who stands to the right of the prince, at a lower elevation reflective of his lesser status. He carries two objects: a bag suspended on a cord, useful for holding fish, and a second object with a handle, perhaps used to stun and kill them. The foreground scene, fully half the composition, is given over to the prince’s horse and groom. As in other passages of the drawing, a minute black ink line delineates the forms, while other colors of ink—here red and blue—are used sparingly to highlight components of the horse’s tack and caparison and the kerchief knotted around the groom’s belt.    In its pastoral theme, technique of execution, and figural components (especially the groom, guardian, and horse), this drawing may be productively compared to An Incident at the Court, a drawing often identified as depicting the young Tahmasp, who has climbed into a tree and is being urged to leave it by a host of figures.[5]   David J. Roxburgh                                  [1] Images of fishing are rare but are also found in Safavid textiles. See a satin lampas published in Bier 1987, cat. 24. [2] Khvāndamīr 1954, 3:559, 569.

The literary subject of a woman’s sacrificing herself on the funeral pyre of her dead husband was popularized in seventeenth-century Iran through the poet Nawʿi Khabushani’s narrative Sūz u Gudāz (Burning and Melting).[1] Set in India, the poem tells of a Hindu bride who vows to cast herself on her bridegroom’s pyre and will not be dissuaded, even by the Mughal emperor himself.[2]   In many ways, however, this painting does not correspond to Nawʿi’s text: the inscription beneath the painting is unrelated to the poem,[3] the body of the bridegroom is missing from the pyre, key figures (such as the Mughal prince who accompanies the bride to the pyre) have been omitted, and the bride’s disrobing is uncalled for. Moreover, examination under transmitted light reveals no traces of text on the reverse side of the folio, indicating that it was not part of a manuscript.[4]   In this illustration the young woman kneels next to a small pyre. She rends her gown in grief, exposing her naked torso, and pulls out locks of her hair, which she casts into the fire. Two other women try to restrain her; below them a man crouches, his turban undone and his facial features contorted with grief. Opposite the fire, an older man sits hunched over, his eyes closed. At the horizon is a group of male observers, the one on the right wearing a European hat.  Dramatic clouds bracket a tree with leaves similar to those found in early seventeenth-century Mughal paintings.[5]   One may conclude that this painting, which blends Persian and Indian elements with European techniques of  modeling and shading and demonstrates knowledge of and interest in the female body, was created as a single-page work illustrating the exotic topic of sati and eroticizing the foreign (here Hindu) woman. This hybrid style is characteristic of Safavid painting in the second half of the seventeenth century.[6]   Mika M. Natif   [1] Farhad 2001, 122–23.

The aristocratic central figure, wearing an ornamented robe and holding a wine cup, leans against a blossoming tree. One of his attendants, kneeling on the left, offers him flowers and a golden tray, while the other carries his quiver of arrows. The languid and lyrical scene is rendered with delicate brushwork and sensitivity to detail evident in the figures’ communicative gestures and gazes and in the variety of naturalistic flowering plants. A long-necked ceramic vase on a golden stand bears traces of an inscription added at a later time and now illegible.    The setting of this painting, with its patterned wall, flowering tree, meandering stream, and blooming ground plants, is typical of garden scenes produced in Uzbek ateliers. The young men’s facial features and squat turbans further support a Shaybanid Central Asian attribution.    The painting is currently mounted as an album page.

The man represented here has attributes of a Nath yogi.[1] As is customary for members of this group, he wears large, round earrings,[2] a black sacred thread (janeo) with a small horn pendant, and a coral-or salmon-colored robe. His face and hands are covered with ashes, and he possesses a begging bowl and a crutch (acal) for supporting his chin or arm during meditation.[3] Accompanied by two white dogs, he is shown sitting in an outdoor landscape, hugging his legs and looking at one of the animals. The dogs frolic around him, their playfulness enlivening the otherwise meditative composition. The painting is executed with extremely delicate brushwork (best seen under magnification) that conveys the artist’s visual sensitivity: textures and facial features are rendered with fine lines and subtle hues, and minute details are articulated with great precision.   This page was part of a now-dispersed album of painting and calligraphy. Known as the Salim Album, it was made for Prince Salim, the future Mughal emperor Jahangir (r. 1605–27), at a time when he was in rebellion against his father, Akbar (r. 1556–1605).[4] Several paintings from the album illustrate non-Islamic religious subjects that were of interest to both Akbar and Jahangir;[5] some also represent known figures at the Mughal court.[6] The particular features of this yogi—his round face, full cheeks, small nose, thin lips, and slanted eyes—may be seen as an attempt to render him in a personalized manner even if the artist was not intending to portray a specific individual. The painting is bordered above and below by couplets of Persian poetry that refer to the poet-lover who, separated from his beloved, has become an ascetic.[7] A similarly composed page depicting a Nath yogi with a single dog has also been identified as having belonged to the Salim Album.8 Considering their related subject matter, composition, setting, and poetic inscriptions, one can surmise that the two pages faced each other in the album.[9]   Mika M. Natif   [1] The order of yogis is called Nath Sampradaya, or sometimes Kanphata (split-eared) or Gorakhnath: see White 1996, 7–9. [2] Such earrings identify members of the Nath order.

Detailed brushwork and shading give a sense of volume to the bodies of horse and rider; the animal’s galloping stance and the flying bands of the raja’s clothing create the impression of lively motion. Because Raja Karan Singh was alternately an ally and a foe of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707), this portrait, like other art produced in Bikaner during his reign, merges local artistic traditions with Mughal idioms, reflecting both the self-identity of the house of Bikaner and its complex relations with the Mughals.

On the exterior, the bowl has lost much of its glaze and slip-painted decoration. Most of the present interior decoration is overpainting, but the remaining original surfaces provide evidence that the restorer has reconstructed the design with reasonable accuracy.1 The outermost inscription, in red, could be read as al-yumn (felicity).

It is possible that the many sherds from which the bowl was reconstructed before Norma Jean Calderwood purchased it were positioned incorrectly.

The off-white slip that covers this dish has been incised with a complicated design further elaborated in green, yellow, and purplish brown. An equestrian image fills the center of the dish: a crowned horseman wears a garment decorated with vertical stripes and an overlying arabesque, and his yellow horse is embellished with scribbled lines. A vigorous arabesque fills the background behind horse and rider. Running along the rim is an angular guilloche enclosing crosshatched segments of alternating yellow and green. Except for the base, the dish is entirely covered with a white slip and a clear glaze. It has been reassembled from eight fragments, with no significant losses.   The horseman steals a glance backward—as did the potter who made this dish. Although dated to the twentieth century by thermoluminescence testing, the dish imitates a type of sgraffito vessels traditionally known as Aghkand wares, which are said to have been found at Aghkand, in northwestern Iran, and usually assigned to the twelfth century. In 1938, an influential exponent of Persian art, Arthur Upham Pope, singled Aghkand wares out for praise, labeling them “more intellectual, more Persian, and ultimately more interesting” than any comparable ceramics of the period.[2]   Mary McWilliams   [1] The dish was last fired within the past 100 years, according to results of thermoluminescence analysis carried out by Oxford Authentication Ltd. in 2002.

From greater Iran, numerous examples similar to this one, dated or datable to the twelfth through the fourteenth century, have survived. Their precedents—silver ewers from Sasanian Iran and high-fired ceramics from the Tang and Song periods in China—demonstrate the ongoing dialogue between artists in western and eastern Asia. If the thermoluminescence analysis for this ewer is correct, then the dialogue likely continued into the twentieth century.   Most of the known Iranian rooster-head ewers use linear decoration, in luster or underglaze painting, to articulate eye, coxcomb, wattle, beak, and neck ring. In contrast, the features of this bird are suggested only sculpturally. The white body of the ewer is embellished by three circular medallions with incised and pierced interlace motifs that remained watertight because they were filled with glaze. The once-clear glaze has degraded and become iridescent across large areas, partially obscuring the medallions and their pierced openings. Enlivening the otherwise subtle decoration, dabs of cobalt appear set like cabochon sapphires along the handle and run down from the coxcomb.   A ewer of similar shape in the Louvre2 bears an inscription around the base suggesting that it was intended to hold wine. Put to this use, the Calderwood ewer would have been striking—the red liquid appearing dramatically through its pierced medallions.

This small bowl imitates so-called silhouette wares of the Seljuk-Atabeg period (twelfth to thirteenth century), on which black slip was applied directly to the white ceramic body and the pattern carved or incised through the slip before the vessel was covered in glaze (turquoise, as here, or colorless). Original bowls of this shape were purportedly used for collecting alms.[2]   Incised in cursive script on the upper part of this bowl are the words ʿizz (glory), iqbāl (good fortune), and mihtar (prince); the other words in the inscription do not make sense together.[3] On the lower body, carved lines separate the black slip into segments.

A small rectangular sheet of brass was pierced to produce an intricate openwork design, and brass rods topped by round finials were soldered to the sides. The front face was then inlaid with silver and copper (both 99 percent pure). Bold strapwork divides the design into three horizontal registers. The upper and largest zone carries a Kufic pseudo-inscription set against a foliate scroll. The letters are animated with two bust-length human figures and a variety of animals and animal heads.[1]    In the two lower registers, the strapwork is interlaced in nearly symmetrical fashion, creating geometric interstices that are filled with leaves, rosettes, and round bosses. In accord with traditional metalworking technique, the brass sheet was incised and textured to receive the copper inlay, as can be seen where this inlay is missing. The attachment of the silver, however, is unusual and may reflect modern restoration: it appears to have been positioned in parallel strips (usually three) and hammered to make it adhere to the underlying sheet. Both silver and copper inlays are partly decorated with fine incised lines and punch marks.

215371,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This vessel consists of a bulbous body resting on a hollow, slightly flared foot. Three suspension loops project from the rim and would originally have been attached to chains. This object belongs to a relatively large corpus of sixth- to seventh-century CE Byzantine censers, many from Egypt, that depict vignettes from the life of Christ (1). The scenes rendered in relief around the body of this vessel include: the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Baptism, the Crucifixion, and the Women at the Tomb. This iconography evokes Christian sacred history as well as the physical sites to which medieval pilgrims traveled in order to commemorate these holy events (2). A band with an incised floral design decorates the neck and is bordered by a ridge above and below. Small crosses decorate the bases of the suspension loops; a rosette is incised in the bottom of the bowl. Although usually identified as censers, vessels like this could also serve as lamps by filling them with oil and affixing a wick holder to the side of the bowl (3).   In the Byzantine world, luxury aromatic substances were used in liturgical and court ceremonies as well as in the home (4). In the domestic context, incense served the practical purpose of warding off pests and odors. But this utilitarian role also held deeper significance because foul smells were associated with evil powers and demons (5). By repelling pests and alleviating smells, incense served to protect the home from malevolent forces and was even thought to be a cure for physical ailments. Incense was also burned in the prayer corner of the home, thereby uniting its sacred and secular applications. In liturgical and court practices, incense was used to mark ceremonial pathways and to enhance the luxury and display of lavish rituals.    A bowl-shaped body, either open or covered, is the most common form for censers. Footed censers sat on tables or other surfaces and were sometimes fitted with handles; those with loops along their upper rims were equipped with chains and intended to be suspended or swung or both. Censers were cast in various shapes and decorated with diverse abstract and figural motifs. Those ornamented with religious iconography would have been well suited to a liturgical context, but might also have been used in the home as an embellishment for personal prayer or as a particularly efficacious apotropaic device.

304181,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This small head of a young man is turned slightly to the left. Individualized features such as the aquiline nose, the furrowed forehead, thick lips, and small heavy chin give his face a character. The pupils are each rendered by a small hole in the center of the iris. The slight twist of the head to the left tightens the sternomastoid muscle on the right side of the neck and breaks the symmetry of the representation. The subtlety of the plastic rendering suggests that the head belonged to a statuette rather than having been part of a bust from a roundel. The skull, with the exception of the forehead, is covered with short, thick locks and surrounded by a roll wound with a ribbon indicated in shallow relief. If this portrait is a representation of a Hellenistic ruler, this could be the royal diadem twisted around the strophion. The same attribute, however, could be worn by athletes and priests and also occurs on the heads of pseudo-portrait herms.   Royal portraits in the form of small bronze statuettes are known in the Hellenistic period, especially in Ptolemaic imagery, for Ptolemy II Philadelphos (309-246 BCE), perhaps for Ptolemy III Euergetes (246-222 BCE) who would have been assimilated to Hermes-Thoth, and for a late Ptolemaic ruler, perhaps identifiable as Ptolemy X Alexander I (110-109 and 107-88 BCE) (1). However, the head in the Harvard Art Museums, which is thought to have been acquired in Egypt by a previous owner, does not resemble any of these rulers or any other Ptolemy. The build of the face recalls portraits of the Pergamene king Eumenes II (197-158 BCE) (2), and the Seleucid king Antiochos IV Epiphanes (175-164 BCE), but it is not possible to identify this portrait as a representation of either. This small head has the closest affinities with the probable portrait of the brother of Eumenes II, Attalos II (158-138 BCE), although the face of the Harvard head seems more elongated (3). One may detect the influence of Attalid iconography in this portrait type, notably in the curved profile of the nose, comparatively small eyes, round form of the chin below the small mouth, and the thick lips. However, a strophion is not worn in Attalid imagery, except on the coin portraits of Group II of Philhetairos, dated to c. 270-263 BCE. On these coins, the head of the founder of the dynasty, who never took the title of a king, is encircled by such a ring, around which is twisted a fillet whose ends flutter on the neck (4).   The function of such bronze statuettes representing kings remains little understood. One might suppose that these formed part of the decoration of private homes and consequently are to be associated with the category of domestic statuary, well attested for Hellenistic marble sculpture. The head of the statuette under discussion probably reflects a large-scale bronze. According to its possible identification as a king, it would have represented the ruler in heroic nudity holding a lance, which was a sculpture type made especially famous by Alexander the Great.

221580,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This is one of only three known ancient three-dimensional bronze statuettes representing Odysseus’s escape from the cave of Polyphemos the Kyklops—an adventure recounted by Odysseus in Book 9 of Homer’s Odyssey (1). In the story, Odysseus and his companions first intoxicate and blind Polyphemos, which then allows them to prepare to flee his cave by fastening themselves underneath the Kyklops’s sheep. Odysseus hides beneath Polyphemos’s favorite ram, an animal described in heroic terms. Concealed in this way, the hero and his men escape when Polyphemos lets his flock out to graze at dawn. Ironically, the concern for the artist is that Odysseus, who is identifiable by his characteristic conical cap (or pilos), is visible instead of being completely hidden.     In most Greek depictions of the escape episode, Odysseus is stretched out full-length under the ram: his head beneath the ram’s chin or jutting out in front of the animal; his feet or legs emerging between the ram’s hind legs (2). Some Roman examples show Odysseus curled up under the ram’s belly and with his head turned toward the viewer (3). In this version, Odysseus hides under the ram’s belly, although he is not curled up; instead, he protrudes face-up and diagonally from underneath the ram’s right side. This Odysseus has no bottom half: his body ends at the waist in a sort of smear under the ram’s midsection. The group’s left side is unmodeled, except for a few places (the hooves, fleece, and face) that are visible when the viewer observes the composition from its completely modeled right side. The piece was probably intended for right-side viewing only.    NOTES:   1. Odyssey 9.415-65. The other two bronzes are also Roman; see H. B. Walters, Catalogue of the Bronzes, Greek, Roman, and Etruscan in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities, British Museum (London, 1899) nos. 1445 (inv. no. 1772,0307.182) and 1446 (inv. no. 1824,0473.1). Only the front half of BM 1445 remains; Odysseus looks up from between the ram’s forelegs and clutches its shoulders. BM 1446 shows Odysseus under the ram’s belly; Odysseus’s head is front as he grips the ram’s sides with his hands and presses his feet against its haunches. The fleece of BM 1446 is rendered in a pattern of dots and striations similar to the Harvard pi ece.   2. The escape episode is among the earliest known narrative depictions in Greek vase painting; see, for example, a Protoattic “Ram Jug” in Aegina, dated c. 660 BCE, published as Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae (LIMC) Odysseus no. 109. The scene is not uncommon in black-figure vase painting; see, for example, a black-figure lekythos in the manner of the Haimon Painter, dated c. 550 BCE, published as LIMC Odysseus no. 112. Flat-cast bronze relief plaques from the Archaic period (c. 550-500 BCE) are also known; see LIMC Odysseus no. 128. The group that includes Harvard’s example was previously published as Greek, but the alloy’s high zinc content suggests a Roman d ate.  3. Compare BM 1446 (supra 1); the second to third century CE marble group in Rome published in B.

Little space was left undecorated, reflecting a certain horror vacui, a feature of Avar art that also appeared in other medieval artistic production (2). S-curves and curl patterns are explained as tamgas, or clan symbols (3). Included with Harvard’s group of ornaments is one probably unused limestone mold (2001.270.59) that reveals, to some extent, the casting process of the Late Avar Period. Punched holes were also incorporated in the designs, and gilding appears frequently over the bronze. In the Early Avar Period, ornaments were made of beaten rather than cast metal, and designs were embossed.

77123,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This is one of eight flower- or fruit-shaped ornaments (see Related Objects). Each ornament in the group has two attachment holes, and rivets are preserved in eight of these.  The pieces in this group differ in the execution of the incised and stippled decoration and also in size, due to the imperfect casting of four of the pieces. The belt ornaments 2001.270.24 to 2001.270.58 may belong together, as they have a very similar patina.   Copper alloy belt ornaments from the period of Avar domination of Eastern Europe (c. 567-822 CE) have been discovered in thousands of tombs, primarily in what is now Hungary. Many of the belt ornaments in Harvard’s collection most likely belong to the final phase of the Late Period (c. 668-822 CE) of Avar art, during which such ornaments were made of cast bronze and often employed “vine and scroll” motifs as well as other plant designs, including flowers and palmettes (1). Little space was left undecorated, reflecting a certain horror vacui, a feature of Avar art that also appeared in other medieval artistic production (2). S-curves and curl patterns are explained as tamgas, or clan symbols (3). Included with Harvard’s group of ornaments is one probably unused limestone mold (2001.270.59) that reveals, to some extent, the casting process of the Late Avar Period. Punched holes were also incorporated in the designs, and gilding appears frequently over the bronze. In the Early Avar Period, ornaments were made of beaten rather than cast metal, and designs were embossed.

They run from the left end to the left front edge (or about so, with a section cut away), to the turn of the corner at the right front. The slabs look as if they has been cut and broken apart for use, face down, as paving stones. The visible surfaces are fresh, save where there is chipping.  The scene shows a battle between the Greeks and the Amazons. Sarcophagi with scenes of combat between Amazons and Greeks were carved in Italy, Asia Minor, and Attica. Those created around the quarries near Athens were the most satisfying in terms of classical Greek sculptures because, as especially here, they reflect the ideal scenes of combat going back to the Parthenon metopes, passing the era of the Bassae frieze with its Lapiths and Centaurs, and culminating in the friezes of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Amazons were remembered for campaigns in Phrygia, Lycia, and an attack on Theseus at Athens, but the presence of Achilles and the dying Amazon Queen Penthesilea in Roman Amazonomachies suggest the focus was on the battle at Troy, when, late in the war, the Amazons came to aid their cousins Priam and the Trojans.   A sarcophagus such as the Forbes-Gould-Harvard example, which once had a pedimented, temple-roof-shaped lid, would have appealed to a client in western Asia Minor because of its strongly Pheidian to Skopasian flavor. The combats could be thought of as symbolic of life's trials or the ravages of death (many other mythological sarcophagi combined similar themes). Otherwise, the Amazonomachy may have appealed to those persons, in Ionia or Italy, who cherished scenes from the Trojan War and, here, myths in which the Trojan ancestors of the Romans or their exotic allies were prominent.   While looking back to Athens in the fourth century B.C. in passages and specific details, this composition (the long side) with its crowded upper background, its foreshortened casualties in the bottom register, and its elongated combatants in the central area from end to end also looks ahead to Late Antique battle sarcophagi (the Ludovisi Sarcophagus in the Museo Nazionale Romano) when such unclassical elements will mark the beginning of the end of ancient art.

The smooth surface of the exterior preserves faint traces of incised crosses. Punched holes of varying number and configuration decorate the six faces of the pyramidal lid. These perforations allowed scented smoke to escape from the chamber. The lid is attached to the body by a hinge, now broken, in the back and is secured with a latch in the front. A cross-shaped finial—with flared arms of equal length and a single loop at the top—is bolted to the pinnacle of the lid. A chain is attached to the loop.    An almost identical example in a private European collection is dated to the sixth century CE (1). Two censers with similar six-sided bodies and suspension loops but no lids are dated to the fifth to sixth centuries CE (2). Another hexagonal censer of almost identical dimensions has an openwork domed lid cast in the shape of vine leaves. The latter object is attributed to the sixth century and said to have been found in Latakia, Syria (3). These comparisons suggest a sixth-century date also for the Harvard censer.    In the Byzantine world, luxury aromatic substances were used in liturgical and court ceremonies as well as in the home (4). In the domestic context, incense served the practical purpose of warding off pests and odors. But this utilitarian role also held deeper significance because foul smells were associated with evil powers and demons (5). By repelling pests and alleviating smells, incense served to protect the home from malevolent forces and was even thought to be a cure for physical ailments. Incense was also burned in the prayer corner of the home, thereby uniting its sacred and secular applications. In liturgical and court practices, incense was used to mark ceremonial pathways and to enhance the luxury and display of lavish rituals.    A bowl-shaped body, either open or covered, is the most common form for censers. Footed censers sat on tables or other surfaces and were sometimes fitted with handles; those with loops along their upper rims were equipped with chains and intended to be suspended or swung or both. Censers were cast in various shapes and decorated with diverse abstract and figural motifs. Those ornamented with religious iconography would have been well suited to a liturgical context, but might also have been used in the home as an embellishment for personal prayer or as a particularly efficacious apotropaic device.

54472,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This weight is the most finely modeled of the steelyard weights at Harvard. We see the bust of a plump, young emperor, his status marked by both a laurel-wreath crown and armor bearing a gorgoneion. J. S. Crawford, in an unpublished manuscript of the McDaniel collection, suggested that the counterweight represents Nero; however, given the lack of other identifiable portrait types amongst the weights it is more likely to be a more generic imperial image (1). The nose seems flattened or reshaped, and we see similar flattening, or wear, on the face of the gorgoneion. The scale pattern on the figure’s armor is still clearly articulated.   Steelyards were commonly used throughout the ancient Mediterranean. These crossbeams would have a weight, usually in the form of a person or deity, that slid along the bar of the scale to measure bulk goods (2). Not surprisingly, many of the Late Roman and Byzantine examples with known findspots have been found along a coast or in shipwrecks, reflecting their commercial utility. The standard term in English, “steelyard,” is a bit misleading, deriving from the use of similar scales in the area on the north bank of the Thames, London, where steel merchants clustered until 1597. In the Roman period, a wide range of figures was represented on the weights, reflecting the diversity of forms of Roman small bronzes in general. By the fourth to fifth century CE, this multiplicity had narrowed and almost all steelyards used weights represented a generic empress type (e.g., 2007.104.3.A-C) or the goddess Athena (Minerva) (3). Although many late examples have been dated generally to the Late Roman period, the most firmly dated example is from the seventh-century shipwreck of Yassi Ada, off the coast of modern Turkey (4). The holdings of the Harvard Art Museums represent the lively eclecticism of this category of bronze, including busts of an empress type, a Minerva, an emperor and an ambiguous nude.   The basic shape of the bust weights was probably created from the lost-wax process, with later refinements added as the materials cooled. The hollow core was filled with lead to achieve the required weight, and a thin bronze sheet on the bottom capped the lead filling. Variations appear in the manufacture of different categories of the weights. The upper loop, with which the figure would be attached to the upper scale, was aligned in two different directions: the loop on the empress bust weights ran front-to-back, while the Minerva bust weights, in contrast, had a top loop that presents its circular face to the viewer. Furthermore, the Minerva weights possess rectangular socles, and the empress weights have oval socles.   NOTES:   1. Many similar emperor bust weights are known; see N.

54863,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The identity of this figure is ambiguous; suggestions include Attis, Mercury (Hermes), Venus (Aphrodite), and an anonymous female figure. The Mercury attribution is indicated by the helmet, Venus by the nudity, while the anonymous female label was given by default. Mercury, with his vaunted connections to commerce, was a popular choice for Roman steelyard weights, yet the small but pronounced breasts on this object make this interpretation less likely.    The face has a masculine aspect, with heavy modeling. Two strands of hair trail across the top of the forehead. The eyes seem particularly lumpy, and the brow ridge does not correspond with the location of the eyes, which are themselves not symmetrical. The ambiguities and rough form of the weight suggest that the model may have been reshaped; perhaps a Mercury weight model was reconfigured to depict a woman. The main contours of the piece were coarsely rendered with finer details later incised. The back is hollow and traces of the weight’s lead filling are extant.

He extends his left leg and turns the right leg slightly outward. The figure’s feet connect to a rounded base, which is probably modern. Both arms hang down straight and are held a short distance from the body. The hands are broken off just below the wrists. There is some indication of a thumb on the left hand. The musculature on the torso is defined and naturalistic; an erect phallus is represented, and a very long, thin tail curves in a high arch from the back just above the buttocks before merging with the calf of the right leg. The muscles of the back are suggested by an indented area in the center.    The head is very detailed. His hair resembles a cap, forming a ridge along the top of the forehead. Equine ears appear through the hair on either side of the head. He wears a full, pointed beard and heavy mustache, which hangs down on either side of the mouth. Arching eyebrows appear above the eyes, which are indicated by inscribed lines for eyelids, but contain no pupils.    The satyr was a popular Etruscan motif, appearing in various media, such as vase painting (1). Small bronze figurines such as this satyr are well known, and many may have been intended as furniture adornment or ornaments for the house (2). They appear as decorative attachments on objects such as candelabra, oil lamps, heating vessels, tables, and cup stands. The presence of a base suggests this bronze satyr may have been a finial from a candelabrum. Since evidence for the attachment is unclear, however, it alternatively may have been a votive offering.    NOTES:    1. For general bibliography, see A. F.

54951,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The legionary wears a helmet with cheek plates. A ridge on the top of the helmet indicates where a crest, now missing, was attached. The front of the helmet is open. The nose is prominent, and the eyebrows are defined by a horizontal ridge running the width of the forehead. Tiny drill holes form the eyes, and a small, incised line marks the mouth.   The figure wears the typical dress of a Roman legionary. An undecorated cuirass, or breastplate, covers his chest and abdomen, delineating the muscles of the torso. Raised bands mark the edges at the neck and shoulders. Pteryges (strips of layered leather or fabric) protect the thighs and upper arms; a short row covers his lower abdomen, while a longer row underneath extends to his knee. An armband is indicated below the pteryges on either shoulder. Faint lines on the upper part of his right foot may represent a sandal; the left foot is broken off.    The figure lunges to his right, with the head turned toward the right shoulder, while his body is frontal. He raises his bent right arm in front of his torso, and inscribed lines on his fist indicate fingers. The left leg extends backwards, nearly straight. The left arm is also held back and slightly bent, while the hand is missing; a hole (c. 0.3 cm in diameter) is preserved at the end of the arm. The figure probably held a shield in this hand, similar to a more complete figure in the same pose in Bologna (1). The back of the figure is flattened and finished for attachment. A triangular hole (c. 1.4 cm high and 0.9 cm wide) is present in the lower part of the torso and was intended to receive a peg (2).    This figure once decorated a balteus, or breastplate, for a horse and would have attached to a metal plate, which would have been riveted to a leather belt around the horse’s neck. Baltei of this type generally depicted battle scenes of Romans fighting barbarians, and surviving examples show surprisingly little variation in the types of figures and their composition (3). The Harvard figure likely engaged a barbarian in single combat, possibly positioned on the center of the balteus similar to examples from Elea and Aosta (4). Horse armor with such elaborate decoration was clearly a valuable possession. Although intended for protection and probably a required item of equipment, each balteus was likely chosen by an individual soldier according to his own taste and wealth.    NOTES:   1. See U.

While the example from Elea lacks the actual breastplate, a few complete examples do exist, with similar figures also arranged in a battle scene; see F.

57001,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Herakles stands with right knee raised, resting on an amphora (3.5 cm high and 2.15 cm in diameter), which lies on its side. He props his right elbow on his right knee, supporting his head on his hand as he leans over. His left leg stands on the ground, slightly bent at the knee. He holds his club down in his left hand propped on the ground.    The figure is beardless and nude. His chest muscles are relaxed as he leans forward. A crease across his waist is the natural result of a slouching posture. Genitalia are represented, as are the muscles of the shoulders, arms, and legs. Roughly incised lines indicate fingers and toes. His facial features are somewhat crude, particularly the eyebrows and large eyes, which are outlined by deep, inscribed lines. Tiny, punctuated semicircles represent locks of hair. An inscribed line along the spine marks the curve of the back.    The statuette stands on a base, perhaps of an Ionic column, indicating that the object was attached to an implement or utensil, probably as a finial from a candelabrum. Small, circular marks decorate the base along the edge of the upper register. On the lower register a slight beveling of the metal creates a horizontal band. The underside is hollow.   The workmanship suggests Etruscan manufacture of the middle to late fourth century BCE (1). The tired Herakles with wine-amphora was a popular theme in Etruria in the fourth century BCE, probably an adaptation or copy of a Greek statuary type. The image of the tired Herakles emerges c. 465-460 BCE and was first depicted on a metope from the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, on which Athena comforts the tired hero who has just defeated the Nemean lion, his first labor (2). Herakles stands in the center, resting his head on his hand and his right foot on the back of the fallen lion. In this prototype, the combative Herakles is replaced by a weary, worn figure resting after the struggle. Such depictions of the human condition typically mark Classical interpretations of Greek heroes (3). Variations seen in earlier statuettes of Lysippan poses with one knee raised, such as the Lateran Poseidon type and the so-called Lysippean Jason, may indicate early and late Classical inspirations (4).   The amphora may represent a prize for victory or hold the wine for the oinisteria, the libation poured as part of the hero’s cult. Most Etruscan candelabra of this period have been found in burial contexts. Candelaba, as luxury or high-status objects, were used to provide light for banquets and other important events; as grave gifts, they performed the same function for the deceased (5).   NOTES:   1. An iconographic parallel, although stylistically different, comes from Spina with two figurines, made from the same mold, coming from tomb 58-C of Valle Perga and dated c. 380-370 BCE; see E. Hostetter, Bronzes from Spina 1: The Figural Classes (Mainz, 1986) 227, nos. 23-24, pls. 28 and 29 (candelabra). These are mirror images of the Harvard example.

57678,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This bronze handle in the shape of a crouched hound was once part of a folding knife. The hound’s molded ears are flat on the top of its head, which is held low; the muzzle is long, with a mouth and nose indicated; the eyes are oblong and on the sides of the head. The hound wears a collar that was once decorated with a non-bronze material, and there is a small circular green decoration on the top of the collar, which XRF analysis indicates may be malachite. Its rather short forelegs are extended under its chin, and its flattened hindquarters are just visible emerging from stylized foliage, decorated with two more circular green decorations, and ending in the square-sectioned handle, to which the knife blade was secured by means of an iron rivet. The blade would have folded into a narrow slit in the belly of the hound. The patina is dark gray, with light brown areas and some iron encrustation near the hinge for the blade.    Folding knives came into use in the classical period, particularly under the Romans (1). Hound folding knives were popular in northern Europe, particularly Britain, and frequently show the hounds chasing rabbits.

Many of the belt ornaments in Harvard’s collection most likely belong to the final phase of the Late Period (c. 668-822 CE) of Avar art, during which such ornaments were made of cast bronze and often employed “vine and scroll” motifs as well as other plant designs, including flowers and palmettes (1). Little space was left undecorated, reflecting a certain horror vacui, a feature of Avar art that also appeared in other medieval artistic production (2). S-curves and curl patterns are explained as tamgas, or clan symbols (3). Included with Harvard’s group of ornaments is one probably unused limestone mold (2001.270.59) that reveals, to some extent, the casting process of the Late Avar Period. Punched holes were also incorporated in the designs, and gilding appears frequently over the bronze. In the Early Avar Period, ornaments were made of beaten rather than cast metal, and designs were embossed.

117306,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This sistrum, which has preserved the handle and most of the curving frame, would once have had three metal crossbars threaded through the holes in the frame that would have rattled when shaken. The top of the curved frame is decorated with four small cats, perhaps a mother with kittens, modeled in the round. Three of the cats are reclining, and all face in the same direction. The largest reclining cat reaches out its right paw to touch the back of the central cat sitting in front of it. The sitting cat is flanked by two reclining cats in mirror image of each other, each touching the central cat with one paw, their tails curving below them. On either side of the frame below the cat tails is an incised egg-and-dart pattern. A raised band follows the top edges of the frame.   On each side where the frame merges with the handle is a cobra, facing outward, and wearing the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. The bodies are partially separated from the handle. Just above the handle, between the rising sides of the loop, is a seated animal, probably a cat, facing in the same direction as the cats on the top of the handle. No tail or other details beyond the ears and face are preserved.   The handle itself is decorated on both sides with a head of the goddess Hathor, which is more carefully rendered on one side than the other, although the depiction overall is not as detailed as 2001.212. The wig, almond-shaped eyes, nose, and cow ears are visible on both sides. The face is heart shaped, but rather more pointed on the back. The head ends below the neck in a crescent bust. Below the head of Hathor is a molded floral shape above the head of a standing Bes, which is sculpted with a clear front and back. Bes stands, hands on hips, frontally on an upturned cone, with reclining animals (probably felines) on either side. The hair on the back is rendered in a hatched pattern. Bes has wide hips and a tail reaching to the ground line (1). The sistrum ends on a square base.   The sistrum was a musical instrument that created sound through the rattling of its metal pieces; the Egyptian name for these instruments, sesheshet or sesheshat, is onomatopoetic and mimics the instruments’ rattling sound (2). The instrument played an important part in the rites of the goddesses such as Hathor and Isis. It is often depicted as insignia of young female participants of these cults. With the spread of the Isis cult, examples of sistra have been found throughout the Roman world, including Pompeii (3). Many examples incorporate the head of Hathor along with other ornaments, although some are unadorned.    NOTES:   1. The presence of Bes in conjunction with the images of Hathor and cats (referencing Bastet) suggest that this sistrum had an apotropaic function. Thanks are due to E. Russo, Brown University, for this information.   2. E. Russo, pers. comm.   3. S. De Caro, The National Archaeological Museum of Naples (Naples, 1996) 132.     Lisa M.

The hair, represented by straight lines, is bound by a fillet, or rolled diadem of the type introduced to the Mediterranean world in the age of Alexander the Great. The left ear is hardly preserved, being mostly gouged away. The right ear is summarily treated, as is the face, with the head evidently carved to be seen from its own right side only.

Additional rods, connected to the sides of the lower legs, rise diagonally to the bottom of the ring between the legs where three pendants hung from small loops; two of the three pendants are missing. The lower element of the remaining bud-shaped pendant appears to have been broken off. The decoration on the ring consists of eight groups of double spirals placed end to end, set off on a smooth background and bordered above and below by a narrow, rounded band. The interior of the ring is smooth and undecorated. The exterior surfaces of the upper legs are also framed by narrow, rounded bands.

The hair and beard are worn. There is considerable incrustation.   Evidently once part of a Roman household herm, the head is of Greek Imperial workmanship, perhaps to be dated in the first to second centuries A.D. The style has something reminiscent of the head of Zeus by Pheidias at Olympia, as transmitted through derivatives of the fourth century B.C. The quality of carving suggests this herm came from Attica or the Greek islands, for it has a sensitivity and lack of mechanical production not found in the decorative sculptures from Pompeii and Herculaneum.   A filleted head of Zeus or Dionysos of an Asiatic cult type, seemingly from Cyprus, is a slightly smaller variant of this head, perhaps from the same workshop along the western coast of Asia Minor or in the Greek islands.

The ears are prominent on the sides of the head, and there are some details apparent around the eyes and snout, but overall there is not the same kind of surface detail on this bull as appears on others in the Harvard collection. The legs are unfinished, with jagged metal on the fronts and backs. The long tail is attached to the body and the back right leg. The feet are connected to a flat rectangular base.   This object is a modern piece in the style of a Late Period Egyptian Apis bull. The figure of a striding bull with a sun disc and uraeus between its horns refers to the cult of the bull in its association with the sun god, and by extension, kingship. The wild bull, as the embodiment of aggression and sexual potency, was incorporated into royal imagery. Although there were several bull cults throughout Egypt, the best known is that of the Apis bull of Memphis, the location of the ancient capital. From at least the First Dynasty onward, the Apis bull was associated with the king, and a yearly procession of the sacred animal celebrated its cult (1). It is known from inscriptions as the incarnation of the god Ptah and, after its death, was associated with Osiris. In later periods, particularly as the pharaonic tradition waned, the Apis bull procession grew in popularity among the common people. Only one bull at a time was identified as the sacred Apis bull, probably determined by special markings. It was kept in its own sanctuary near the temple of Ptah, and when it died, it was buried with lavish ceremony in the necropolis at Saqqara, just outside Memphis. Cambyses, the Persian king who conquered Egypt in 525 BCE, allegedly committed one of the gravest sins when he killed the Apis bull, as recorded by Herodotus (3.27-29). The Ptolemaic rulers, however, continued the tradition of maintaining the sacred bull, and its cult remained active into the Roman period.   The Late Period bronzes are highly standardized, producing the angular form of a striding bull. Herodotus writes that one of the markings found on the sacred Apis bull of Memphis was the likeness of an eagle on its back (3.28). This report finds a parallel in the markings seen on many of the bronze bull statuettes produced in the first millennium BCE, often executed in a secondary metal inlay. All such bull figurines display outstretched wings across their shoulders and haunches, although the marking can vary in terms of details, including winged discs, scarabs, and vultures. In between the two outstretched wings, across the backs, rests a rectangular saddle blanket. These markings appear on three of the Harvard pieces, clearly on 1919.525 and more faintly on 1967.11 (2).

168142,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The Apis bull stands on an oblong base; both the bull and base are decorated with lines and symbols. Two borders encircle the front of the sun disc between its horns, ending at a small impression where a uraeus would have been. The bull has incised lines all over the face and body, some of which still contain inlaid silver. The lines on the stylized face outline the brow, piriform eyes, and nostrils. The nose and mouth are wide, indicated by long gashes, and the ears are pressed flat against the skull below the spiral horns. The bull’s neck is encircled by several rows of incised bands, including a middle section that resembles a Greek meander pattern. On the back of the bull, below the bands, is a falcon with wing extended on the left side and a vulture on the right side. Below this is a winged sun disc. The bull has a long downward-pointing tail, with impressions to indicate locks of hair. The legs are stocky and thick, with hooves indicated.   The base has an incised line around the periphery. There are also raised symbols, perhaps hieroglyphics, or some approximation thereof, within a rectangular border between the feet on the right side, as well as a triangular symbol at the front. The underside of the base is concave. This object may be a modern piece in the style of a Late Period Egyptian Apis bull.   The figure of a striding bull with a sun disc and uraeus between its horns refers to the cult of the bull in its association with the sun god, and by extension, kingship.

168617,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Only the upper part of this smiting figure survives, its body bent backward. The back of the figurine is featureless, including the back of the head and attenuated conical headdress. The face is round and large with a shapeless, fleshy nose and pierced semicircular ears that extend out from the head. Deep circular holes denote the eyes, and a crescent-shaped slash defines the mouth, which is set in a receding chin. The proper left arm extends outward from the elbow and the proper right arm is lifted in a partial smiting pose. The left hand, clenched in a fist, preserves a hole for attaching a now-lost item. A somewhat similar, although more carefully modeled, figurine was excavated at the Late Bronze Age site of Enkomi on Cyprus (1).    The geographical area of the Levant, comprising the regions of present-day Israel, Lebanon, western Syria, and south-central Turkey, produced an extraordinary number of small copper alloy figurines from the end of the third millennium into the beginning of the first millennium BCE (2). Most of these figurines depict a standing male figure with left foot advancing and right arm raised in a position of smiting (3). Often the hands are pierced with holes to hold weapons or armor. These separate elements are preserved in a few examples, the most spectacular being a warrior holding a spear and shield found in a late thirteenth or early twelfth century BCE building at Enkomi on Cyprus (4). The figurines have a wide distribution, with examples found as far away as Greece, but the majority is concentrated along the Mediterranean coast of the Levant (5).   While the figurines share a common conceptual underpinning, the actual forms and styles of the small copper alloys display a remarkable range of diversity. In general, they appear to move along a spectrum from those that include a high degree of Egyptianizing elements, presumably produced in regions closer to Egypt, to those showing stronger affinities with the Hittite artistic tradition of central Turkey. Such stylistic features are evident in the shape and type of the tall crown, the form of the short skirt or kilt, and the proportions of the body. The basic iconography of the smiting figure is derived from the Egyptian image of Pharaoh defeating his enemies; yet, there is no exact parallel in Egypt, indicating a peculiarly Levantine iconographic conception. The figure most likely represents a deity, sometimes identified as either Baal or Reshep, two West Semitic gods. Although no definitive evidence exists to support these attributions, some examples have horns on their headdresses, which are a Near Eastern attribute of divinity (6). Where archaeological contexts are sufficiently well preserved, the figurines are clearly associated with cultic spaces. The largest group of excavated figurines comes from several locations in the temple complex at Byblos on the Lebanese coast, while another set was excavated in a Late Bronze Age temple complex at Kamid el-Loz in inland Lebanon (7). The precise dating of the figurines remains fraught for several reasons. First, many were hoarded and only buried well after their date of manufacture. Second, there is only poor information available, if there is any at all, on the provenience of a large portion of the figurines in museum collections. Finally, while the overall conception of the figurines unites them as a group, the diversity of individual features and styles often makes stylistic comparisons difficult.    NOTES:    1. J.-C.

168932,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The seated cat faces frontally, with its long tail resting on its right side on a flat, thin base. The cat has an incised collar of two bands. Lines also indicate the whiskers and fill the area in the triangular, pointed ears. The eyes and nose are modeled. The forelimbs are tubes with no indication of joints, ending in simple paws. The hind limbs are not differentiated from the back of the cat, and only the paws are indicated. Under the tail is a circular-sectioned tang, indicating that the cat was an attachment or that it originally had a more complicated base. There is also a vertical loop on the back of the neck, possibly for suspension (1).    The seated cat was the most popular animal depicted in bronze during the first millennium BCE and accompanied the increasingly widespread recognition of sacred animal cults from the Late Period through the Ptolemaic (664-30 BCE) (2). The house cat, as the domesticated counterpart to the wild feline, especially the lion, appears in Egyptian art at least as early as the Middle Kingdom (c. 2134-1665 BCE). The male, or tomcat, was associated with the sun god, and in the New Kingdom (c. 1571-1076 BCE) played an important role in the Book of the Dead as the slayer of the Apophis serpent, enemy of the sun god. In all likelihood, however, the bronze statuettes represent the female cat and are connected with a series of goddesses, in particular Bastet.   Bastet was an ancient goddess, known from at least the beginning of the Old Kingdom (c. 2687-2191 BCE). She and several other goddesses associated with the solar element were represented as feline-headed. Over time, she acquired the more benevolent characteristics of the domesticated cat, known for its fertility and nocturnal sex life, in opposition to the more threatening leonine aspects assumed by the goddess Sekhmet. In this role, Bastet and, by extension, cats were seen to be peaceful and protective. While there were other goddesses who manifested themselves as cats, for example Pakhet (“She Who Scratches”) in Middle Egypt, Bastet’s supremacy rose during the first millennium, probably as a direct result of her connection to the rulers of Dynasty 22 (c. 931-725 BCE) who came from Bubastis, the ancient cult center of Bastet.    Bubastis (modern Tell Basta near Zagazig in the eastern Delta), in addition to other Egyptian sites, became the site of a large cat cemetery at the temple of Bastet, in which mummified cats were deposited as votives. Skeletal evidence suggests that the mummified cats had been intentionally killed while still young, rather than having been cherished pets that died of natural causes (3). Small cat figurines were often wrapped in the linen bandages of the mummified remains, which were in turn placed in bronze or wooden containers in the shape of seated cats. Many of the larger, hollow-cast bronze cats can be interpreted in this way and retain an opening into the body cavity. The majority of the bronzes, however, were dedicated in shrines.   The dedication of cat mummies and votive statues has been connected to a highly institutionalized cult of the king, which may explain the large number and standardized iconography of the bronzes (4). Although there is a wide variety of types preserved, most of the bronzes achieve an anatomical correctness and express the essence of cats—haughty dignity and aloofness. They assume the seated position with head held erect and tail curled along the right side as in the hieroglyphic sign. One or both of the ears tend to be pierced, and gold hoop earrings remain on some examples. The frequent presence of a scarab beetle placed on the forehead and a pectoral on the chest suggests the protective function and solar connection of such figures.   NOTES:   1. See M. Hill and D.

168933,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This sistrum handle depicts a molded bust of the goddess Hathor, whose face appears on the front and back, although one side is more carefully rendered than the other. She is frontal, wearing a prominent wig, parted in the middle and with curls at each end. Her cow-shaped ears are rendered flat on the outside of the wig. The face is round, with large wide-set eyes, a broad flat nose, wide mouth, round cheeks, and flat chin. Below the chin is a raised area, and a plain broad collar is rendered. On both sides of the head of Hathor, facing outward, is a cobra wearing a crown. The cobras are attached to the handle at the top of the crown and at the body, although the area behind the heads and most of the crowns are completely detached from the handle.    Above the bust of Hathor is a seated cat, which is modeled in the round, possibly associating this piece with Bastet (1). The cat sits on a molded band that resembles an entablature, with a beaded border at the top and bottom and a row of rectangles resembling triglyphs in the middle. The tip of the cat’s left ear is missing. The cat faces in the same direction as the more carefully rendered side of the handle. On either side of the cat are the remains of the curving frame that would have held the crossbars that created the rattling sound. The handle itself is cylindrical, with raised bands at the top and bottom.   The sistrum was a musical instrument that created sound through the rattling of its metal pieces; the Egyptian name for these instruments, sesheshet or sesheshat, is onomatopoetic and mimics the instruments’ rattling sound (2). The instrument played an important part in the rites of the goddesses such as Hathor and Isis. It is often depicted as insignia of young female participants of these cults. With the spread of the Isis cult, examples of sistra have been found throughout the Roman world, including Pompeii (3). Many examples incorporate the head of Hathor along with other ornaments, although some are unadorned.     NOTES:   1. Thanks are due to E. Russo, Brown University, for this information.   2. E.

168939,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This compact, squatting silenus sits squarely on a flat base. He draws his knees up to his stomach and extends his bearded head forward over his kneecaps. He grips the left and right edges of his beard with both hands. The compactness of his pose lends him a tense air, seen in the tightly bent and carefully modeled spine and subtly rendered volumes of his sides and back. His turned-up toes add a further touch of animation. The hair of the silenus extends in a pointed mass down the upper part of his back. Two broad lateral waves extend from side to side below the base of his head. A raised ridge of hair, concave in profile and extending between his ears, frames his forehead. His beard extends down to a drooping point with a small secondary tuft below the lower lip. The two long, outwardly pointing halves of his moustache extend nearly to the edge of the beard in front of his clenched fists. He has large, round eyes. Both hair and beard bear extensive traces of painstakingly incised individual locks. Surfaces of the statuette show heavy wear. Two unusual features deserve special comment. One is a button-shaped projection at the top of his head. The other is a small irregular projection, seemingly broken off, rising from the bottom tip of his hair mass (1).    This small, crouching silenus does not reflect the boisterous and lusty self-confidence characteristic of silenoi and seen in so many of his bronze contemporaries (2). He belongs to a venerable group of squatting and crouching figures in bronze and terracotta that are descended from similar bronze figures in the Greek Geometric period, c. 800-700 BCE (3). These in turn have Egyptian forerunners, such as the compact squatting block statues that are common from the Middle Kingdom onwards. During the seventh to early sixth centuries BCE, ceramic workshops in Corinth, on Rhodes, and probably elsewhere produced an interesting series of terracotta statuettes and plastic vessels of crouching, kneeling and seated silenoi. A black steatite crouching Ethiopian boy of perhaps a late Hellenistic date replicates the pose of this silenus almost exactly (4).   The masterfully modeled back-muscles, combined with lingering Archaic conventions for representing his hair, beard, and moustache, suggest a date c. 500 to 480 BCE. One suspects that he was made in a workshop on mainland Greece, perhaps at Corinth, although the find from Herculaneum must allow a longer possible date range.    NOTES:   1.

He wears the Double Crown and traces of a uraeus or spiral decoration remain on the front. The figure lacks definition in its modeling, but shows torsion in the back of the lower body.    Harpokrates represents the god Horus as a child, shown nude with the side-lock of youth on the right side of his head and his right index finger to his mouth. As the son of Osiris and Isis, he gained immense popularity during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, during which time the production of bronze figurines of Harpokrates flourished. He often wears the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, a feature common in first millennium Egypt when youthful deities acquired kingly attributes. Another characteristic headdress is the nemes head cloth, although frequently the boy is depicted with either a shaven head or a tight-fitting skull cap. His nude body typically retains the roundness of flesh associated with young boys. The child-god could be represented seated, striding, or squatting. When seated, he assumes a semi-reclining position derived from that of a baby on its mother’s lap; many of the smaller examples of these figurines may originally have belonged with a seated Isis figure (1). Suspension loops for attachment as a pendant indicate an amuletic connection that may have been particularly associated with young children.    NOTES:   1. G.

173033,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This stamp is unique to the Harvard collection for having an inscription in Greek and for not having the inscription reversed. The impression left by this stamp would have been backwards. The upper edges of the stamp plate are decorated with notches; the comparatively small ring handle, which is attached to its back, bears a knob on top. A small scroll fills the corners between the handle and the plate, and a horizontal bar divides the two lines of text.    The stamp reads: ACTEPIOV IOVΔEѠC   Possibly translating as: “Of Asterias, the Jew.”   Each of the six Roman bronze stamps in the Harvard Art Museums consists of a plate, on which the die of the stamp is carved, and a ring, attached to the back of the plate, which serves as a handle for applying the stamp (1). With the exception of 1977.216.3250, Harvard’s stamps are approximately the same size (c. 5-6 cm long and 2-3 cm wide), and all are inscribed with text. Stamps were produced in a variety of shapes. Most are rectangular, but they could also be elliptical, circular, rhomboid, or in the shape of a tabella ansata, a foot, or, less commonly, a hand. Five of the six stamps in the Harvard Art Museums are rectangular. Four of these have two lines of writing inscribed on them; one other rectangular stamp contains a single line of text, which is limited to initials. The sixth stamp, 1977.216.1963, takes the shape of a foot and also has only one line of writing. This stamp appears to contain pseudo-alphabetic characters. Four others are inscribed in Latin, with the lettering raised and written backwards, a mirror image of the text the stamp would produce. 1977.216.3250 is inscribed in Greek letters but not written retrograde, meaning that the stamp’s impression would have been backwards.   Many types of objects in the ancient world bore stamped impressions, including amphorae, roof tiles, bricks, lamps, glass vessels, and terra sigillata (fine pottery). Textiles and bread were also sometimes stamped, and stamps like Harvard’s may have been used for such a purpose (2). Roof tiles and bricks were being stamped in Greece as early as the Archaic period. In the West, the earliest evidence for stamps comes from amphorae dated from the end of the fourth to the beginning of the third centuries BCE (3).   The texts of stamps most often refer to the name of the producer or manufacturer of the product in the genitive case (e.g., 1978.495.34 “of Cossinus Eutychianus”). In certain instances, the name is written using ligatures or abbreviations. Other stamps include an image such as a leaf (hedera) or an abstract pattern, while some stamps have writing in what seems to be an imitation of alphabetic characters, although it is clearly not Latin or Greek (4). In these cases, where the recipients of such goods were most likely illiterate, the presence of a stamp on the object may have sufficed to guarantee a certain level of quality. Stamps could have varying degrees of decoration along the border and may or may not have a horizontal element to divide separate lines of text (5). The extent a stamp was used varied according to workshop; certain workshops continued to use their stamps until the writing was no longer legible before replacing them (6).   NOTES:   1.

The edge of the disc is raised, and the surface is slightly concave.    Both men are slightly bent forward, looking at each other, with their faces and legs in profile but their torsos in three-quarter view. They are naked except for shoes and brimmed hats (petasoi); the man on the left also wears a cloak, clasped at his neck and hanging over his back. Incised hair is visible under the men’s hats; the hair of the man on the right is slightly longer. The man on the left leans forward, holding a spear in his left hand, with his fingers resting on his chin. His right arm is bent at the elbow and held in front of his chest, his left leg is bent with the foot behind him, and his right leg is held straight.   The man on the right holds his left arm behind is back, while his right arm is bent, reaching out to pat the head of the swan. His right leg is bent and held forward, while his left leg is locked. The body of the swan is partially hidden behind the man on the right. The swan's body faces left, its feet placed between the man in front of him, and its wings are held slightly aloft. Its head is turned in the opposite direction from its body, toward the man on the right. Details of the bodies of the men, particularly the musculature, and of the body of the swan are indicated by solid and stippled lines.   The obverse of the mirror is smooth, with some small scratches. Decoration on the obverse consists of incised volutes and tendrils at the juncture of the disc and the handle or tang. The perimeter of the disc on the obverse is lower than the majority of the surface. The tang is broken at the end, and a large blob of copper alloy is present on the obverse of the tang. There is a long gash through the lower portion of the disc of the mirror.   In Greek mythology, the god Zeus, while in the form of a swan, seduced the mortal woman Leda. She later had four children, hatched from two eggs. Two of the children were mortal and two of the children were divine. These four children were Helen of Troy; Clytemnestra, wife of Agamemnon; and the Dioskouroi, Kastor and Polydeukes (Castor and Pollux). The slight difference in the men’s apparel shown here might be to indicate which of the men was divine (often shown by nudity) and which was mortal (here, the man in the cloak).   This mirror belongs to a group called the Three-leaved Wreath Group, named for the distinctive border on the engraved side attributed to a workshop in Orvieto, Italy (1).   There are ten Etruscan bronze mirrors in the collection of the Harvard Art Museums, ranging in date from the early fifth century to the mid second century BCE. All the mirrors bear engraved designs, and the more elaborately decorated medallions contain scenes involving human or divine figures. Identifiable subjects include a seated Hermes and Lasa (1932.56.38), as well as two young men wearing short chitons and Phrygian caps on 1932.56.37, who may be the Dioskouroi (2). The subjects depicted on other mirrors are more difficult to identify with certainty. One such example is a scene depicting two young men flanking two women, one of whom is nude, in front of an architectural structure (1977.216.1995.A-B); it has been suggested that the figures may be Helen, Clytemnestra, and the Dioskouroi (3). Another scene, less well preserved, shows a figure wearing a peplos and helmet flanked on the left by a man in a short tunic and boots, and on the right by an unidentified woman wearing a peplos and Phrygian cap (1977.216.2311). The central figure is most likely Athena (Etruscan Menrva), and while the figure on the left leans on a club similar to the one often carried by Herakles, it is unusual for that hero to be shown clothed (4). The three stand before a two-story Ionic structure.   Two mirrors in the collection show signs of an interesting afterlife. The disc of 1977.216.2311 has been perforated in ten places, probably as a means of ensuring that the object would be useless to the living and could be permanently dedicated to the deceased; a less plausible suggestion is that the mirror was reused as a strainer (5). Another mirror in the collection (1977.216.3422), if it is ancient, seems to have been reworked in modern times by an engraver who added to the medallion a female bust, a recumbent male, and an inscription. Neither the style nor the subject of the engraving corresponds to examples known from other Etruscan mirrors, and both the engraving and the inscription appear to have been made with a modern instrument (6).

175357,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The rectangular stamp bears the letters and interpuncts “P · D · N · A” in retrograde. The attached suspension ring has a squared hoop on the exterior rather than a round one. The interpuncts rise across the stamp, placed where there is the most room between the letters: the first is low between P and D, the second is at mid-line between D and N, and the third is high between N and A. The abbreviation is untranslatable.   Each of the six Roman bronze stamps in the Harvard Art Museums consists of a plate, on which the die of the stamp is carved, and a ring, attached to the back of the plate, which serves as a handle for applying the stamp (1). With the exception of 1977.216.3250, Harvard’s stamps are approximately the same size (c. 5-6 cm long and 2-3 cm wide), and all are inscribed with text. Stamps were produced in a variety of shapes. Most are rectangular, but they could also be elliptical, circular, rhomboid, or in the shape of a tabella ansata, a foot, or, less commonly, a hand. Five of the six stamps in the Harvard Art Museums are rectangular. Four of these have two lines of writing inscribed on them; one other rectangular stamp contains a single line of text, which is limited to initials. The sixth stamp, 1977.216.1963, takes the shape of a foot and also has only one line of writing. This stamp appears to contain pseudo-alphabetic characters. Four others are inscribed in Latin, with the lettering raised and written backwards, a mirror image of the text the stamp would produce. 1977.216.3250 is inscribed in Greek letters but not written retrograde, meaning that the stamp’s impression would have been backwards.   Many types of objects in the ancient world bore stamped impressions, including amphorae, roof tiles, bricks, lamps, glass vessels, and terra sigillata (fine pottery). Textiles and bread were also sometimes stamped, and stamps like Harvard’s may have been used for such a purpose (2). Roof tiles and bricks were being stamped in Greece as early as the Archaic period. In the West, the earliest evidence for stamps comes from amphorae dated from the end of the fourth to the beginning of the third centuries BCE (3).   The texts of stamps most often refer to the name of the producer or manufacturer of the product in the genitive case (e.g., 1978.495.34 “of Cossinus Eutychianus”). In certain instances, the name is written using ligatures or abbreviations. Other stamps include an image such as a leaf (hedera) or an abstract pattern, while some stamps have writing in what seems to be an imitation of alphabetic characters, although it is clearly not Latin or Greek (4). In these cases, where the recipients of such goods were most likely illiterate, the presence of a stamp on the object may have sufficed to guarantee a certain level of quality. Stamps could have varying degrees of decoration along the border and may or may not have a horizontal element to divide separate lines of text (5). The extent a stamp was used varied according to workshop; certain workshops continued to use their stamps until the writing was no longer legible before replacing them (6).   NOTES:   1.

178388,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This lunate razor is decorated with very fine incised lines. The decoration is the same on both sides: there are seven parallel curved lines on the blunt side. Above them is a series of interlocking isosceles triangles; in this band, a circular hole pierces the blade. The blade thins toward the edge. The handle is broken off; because razors of this type often had a loop for suspension, it is possible that the handle broke in antiquity and that the hole in the blade may have been drilled at that time to allow for continued suspension.   The razor is an example of V. Bianco Peroni’s type “Veio,” dated to the first half of the eighth century BCE and found generally in central Italy, particularly the Villanovan region (1).   It is difficult to understand the use and symbolism of the bronze objects from Iron Age Italy that are classified as razors. Possibly used for trimming hair or beards, these razors seem to have had some symbolic value. They are typically found in male burials, and their inclusion in grave goods may indicate that the deceased was a man of mature age; or, in cases where they are found in female burials, they may be indicative of the owner’s elevated social status (2). Some razors have been found with fibulae fastened through the handle, demonstrating that they could be worn (3). Many examples have repaired handles, showing that the razors were important enough to fix if broken (4).   Razors are typically plain or covered with incised decoration, most frequently lines, bands of interlocking triangles, meanders, lines of dots hatched swastikas, and Maltese crosses. The two-edged examples, like 1987.135.28, more often bear incised concentric circles or have decorative perforations on the blade. Often there are decorative spurs, crescents, or volutes on the handles, depending on the type.   NOTES:   1. V.

179594,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This hand-held scale, or tumbrel, was used to measure coins (1). The device is composed of two oblong copper alloy pieces, hinged at their midpoints (2). The smaller, thinner piece is shaped to fit within the larger one. Each arm has a leaf-shaped terminal at one end and a rounded terminal at the other. Simple circles of regular size embellish the object (2). When the arms are closed, only the decorated surfaces remain visible.    To operate the scale, the user positioned one piece vertically at its rounded end, forming a fulcrum. The second piece opened horizontally to create the beam (3). The rounded end of the balance is pre-weighted to measure coins of a specific denomination. The leaf-shaped end is flattened to hold the coin. Coins of correct weight tip the scale, causing the coin to fall off. If the coin is of insufficient weight, the beam remains horizontal (4). This scale may have been used to measure two coin types, with each arm weighted to a different denomination (5). The lack of control stamps indicates that the tumbrel was not used for official state measuring.    In the late Roman and early Byzantine eras, scales and weights for measuring coins and precious metals were assembled into portable sets (5). Presumably coins were weighed in groups on a balance scale, and if the expected total weight was insufficient, a tumbrel was used to identify unacceptable coins (6). The compact design of this device made it well suited for inclusion in a measuring kit.   NOTES:   1. Compare G. R. Davidson, Corinth 12: Minor Objects (Princeton, 1952) 194, no. 1466, pl. 88; A.

An indeterminate protrusion marks the front of the skull cap, perhaps indicating a uraeus. The various features are generally indistinct due to the small size. The suspension loop on the back is broken (1).    Harpokrates represents the god Horus as a child, shown nude with the side-lock of youth on the right side of his head and his right index finger to his mouth. As the son of Osiris and Isis, he gained immense popularity during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, during which time the production of bronze figurines of Harpokrates flourished. He often wears the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, a feature common in first millennium Egypt when youthful deities acquired kingly attributes. Another characteristic headdress is the nemes head cloth, although frequently the boy is depicted with either a shaven head or a tight-fitting skull cap. His nude body typically retains the roundness of flesh associated with young boys. The child-god could be represented seated, striding, or squatting. When seated, he assumes a semi-reclining position derived from that of a baby on its mother’s lap; many of the smaller examples of these figurines may originally have belonged with a seated Isis figure (2). Suspension loops for attachment as a pendant indicate an amuletic connection that may have been particularly associated with young children.    NOTES:   1.

188233,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This device was used for creating seals. It originally consisted of two halves that were attached to a suspension loop and swiveled around a pin to open and close. One half is fully intact; only the loop of the other half is preserved. On the inner surface of the remaining half is a five-line inscription framed by an incised circle. It names the owner of the seal as one Nikephoros Poupakes, who is identified as a priest (“Levite”).    Fully intact bivalve seals illustrate how this device functioned (1). The two halves were closed on either side of a blank disc, and force was applied to impress the seal. Bivalve seals were typically used to make impressions in relatively soft materials, such as wax, pitch, or clay (2). The exterior surface of the Harvard seal shows extensive wear concentrated at the center, possibly the result of repeated striking or intense pressure.    Complete bivalve seals from the middle Byzantine period are rare (3). Surviving examples display various combinations of inscriptions, imagery, and monograms on the interior surfaces. An early tenth-century example in Munich is inscribed on one side with five lines providing the name of the owner and on the other side with a monogram of the invocation “Theotokos, help” (4). Two middle Byzantine bivalve seals in Houston have images on both interior surfaces; one example is decorated with abstract animal designs, while the other depicts portraits of St. Peter and St. Paul (5).   The use of the term “Levite” for “priest” is found in two early thirteenth-century Byzantine lead seals (6). Nikephoros’ family name, Poupakes, is attested in the early to middle twelfth century CE (7). The particular form of the O-Y (omicron-upsilon) ligature employed in the Harvard device is present in seals dating from the second quarter of the twelfth century to the second quarter of the fifteenth century (8). Together, these diagnostic features suggest a date for this bivalve seal in the twelfth to thirteenth centuries (9).    NOTES:   1. G. Vikan and J.

191293,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This pendant combines late Roman pagan magical iconography and Christian apotropaic motifs to protect the wearer from the demon, Gyllou (Abyzou), who was thought to harm human children out of jealousy because she was unable to have children of her own (1). On one side, a mounted saint, Sisinnios, rides triumphantly over the demon’s prostrate body and impales her with his spear (2). On the other side, the enthroned Virgin Mary holds Christ on her lap (3). Two nimbed and robed figures, probably angels, raise their hands in homage to the holy pair. While Sisinnios attacks Gyllou directly, the Virgin Mary imbues the object with general apotropaic force. A group of amulets depicting similar motifs is dated to the fifth to seventh centuries CE and localized in the eastern Mediterranean (4).   Because the amulet combats the demon of child-envy, it was probably worn by a woman who was pregnant or desired to have children and sought supernatural protection in this endeavor.

191384,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This flat square weight was used for weighing coins on a balance scale. The inscription provides unusually detailed and precise information concerning the object’s date of issue: twentieth of Phamenoth, eighth indiction (16 March 575 CE). It is rare for early Byzantine weights to be dated to the year, let alone the exact day (1). Furthermore, the weight reveals its Egyptian origin through the calendar system used in the inscription; Phamenoth is the fifth month of the Egyptian calendar.    Byzantine coin weights are often decorated with the images or names of the individual under whose authority the weight was issued. In this instance, the inscription designates one Iulianos, who possesses the relatively low-ranking title of stratelates and was likely a provincial governor or local official. Two of the three figures on the obverse represent the imperial pair Justin II (r. 565-78 CE) and Sophia. As senior emperor, Justin II holds the preeminent position at center, while the empress Sophia appears to his left. Both wear three-pronged crowns; Justin’s is decorated with pendilia (embellishments hanging from the temples). The iconography of the object is unusual; bronze weights from the reign of Justin II and Sophia typically feature only the two rulers with their monogram and an inscription providing the date (2). A third figure appears to Justin’s right and is nimbed but uncrowned. This may be the local authority, Iulianos, mentioned in the inscription (3). Alternatively it could depict Tiberios, who was appointed caesar (junior emperor) on 7 December 574 CE, just three months before this weight was issued. In this case, the lack of a crown would indicate Tiberios’ junior status (4). Tiberios was selected as co-ruler by Sophia, who increasingly assumed imperial authority when Justin II’s mental health declined sharply during the early 570s CE (5). This weight provides what would be the only known image of the imperial triad.   NOTES:   1. For discussion of the date, see F. Heintz, “Investigating a Unique Byzantine Weight,” The Celator 14.10 (2000): 26-28.   2. S. Bendall, Byzantine Weights: An Introduction (London, 1996) 44-45, no. 117.

On the Harvard weight as well as in coinage, Sophia appears to Justin’s left. Although Justin assumes the position of greater importance, Sophia’s presence is nonetheless significant; the empress had never before been represented so prominently on the obverse of coins.   3. I.

193805,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The handle of this lightly piriform mirror terminates in the head of an animal, possibly a deer. A floral design is incised above the handle.   There are ten Etruscan bronze mirrors in the collection of the Harvard Art Museums, ranging in date from the early fifth century to the mid second century BCE. All the mirrors bear engraved designs, and the more elaborately decorated medallions contain scenes involving human or divine figures. Identifiable subjects include a seated Hermes and Lasa (1932.56.38), as well as two young men wearing short chitons and Phrygian caps on 1932.56.37, who may be the Dioskouroi (1). The subjects depicted on other mirrors are more difficult to identify with certainty. One such example is a scene depicting two young men flanking two women, one of whom is nude, in front of an architectural structure (1977.216.1995.A-B); it has been suggested that the figures may be Helen, Clytemnestra, and the Dioskouroi (2). Another scene, less well preserved, shows a figure wearing a peplos and helmet flanked on the left by a man in a short tunic and boots, and on the right by an unidentified woman wearing a peplos and Phrygian cap (1977.216.2311). The central figure is most likely Athena (Etruscan Menrva), and while the figure on the left leans on a club similar to the one often carried by Herakles, it is unusual for that hero to be shown clothed (3). The three stand before a two-story Ionic structure.   Two mirrors in the collection show signs of an interesting afterlife. The disc of 1977.216.2311 has been perforated in ten places, probably as a means of ensuring that the object would be useless to the living and could be permanently dedicated to the deceased; a less plausible suggestion is that the mirror was reused as a strainer (4). Another mirror in the collection (1977.216.3422), if it is ancient, seems to have been reworked in modern times by an engraver who added to the medallion a female bust, a recumbent male, and an inscription. Neither the style nor the subject of the engraving corresponds to examples known from other Etruscan mirrors, and both the engraving and the inscription appear to have been made with a modern instrument (5).

The satyr’s nude body is flattened where it would have attached to the shoulder of the amphora, and it would have been best viewed from above, looking down on the vessel. In spite of the flatness, the satyr’s musculature is carefully depicted in the arms, torso, and legs. His legs are splayed wide, and his feet are supported and connected by two volutes that spiral out from a scallop shell. He holds the nine-chambered syrinx to his mouth with his fingertips and rests his elbows on his knees, while his stomach supports the bottom of the instrument. The satyr’s beard, with thin straight locks, appears on either side of the syrinx, and the hairs on the moustache are rendered with very fine lines. The thick straight locks of hair on his forehead are framed by his large, pointed ears. His eyes, with thick upper and lower lids, and nose are carefully rendered. The length of the handle is decorated by a central row of raised beads that is flanked by a smaller row of beads on each side. The handle thickens and curves as it approaches the top, where it is broken.    Five other examples of this amphora handle type are known, all of which are more complete at the top than the Harvard piece. An exact parallel for the Harvard handle is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1). Four other handles depicting satyrs in a similar style, which are still attached to amphorae, are in the Vatican Museo Gregoriano Etrusco and the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (2). On the Vatican amphora, one satyr drinks from a kantharos while the other gestures toward his stomach; the Berlin amphora has one satyr who plays the syrinx and another who drinks from a kantharos. On the five complete examples, sleeping dogs or deer are shown curled at the top of the handle where it joins the neck of the vessel.    NOTES:   1. See M. Comstock and C. C.

196418,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This statuette of a standing woman wears a hollow skirt with an oval cavity that extends from the bottom partially into the interior. There are no feet; the figure rests on the bottom of the skirt. The long oval skirt is marked by pairs of grooves on both sides and a pair of incised grooves in the center of the front. A pair of rope-like belts encircles the top of the skirt below her narrow waist. She wears a long-sleeved open-breasted jacket similar to others that are seen in bronze statuettes as well as in wall paintings from Cretan sites and from Akrotiri on Thera (1). Her hair hangs down the back of her neck in a knotted curl. Her face is rounded with fairly indistinct features. She raises her right hand, fist clenched, to her forehead; her left arm hangs down by her side to below the belts. There are two raised grooves on both wrists, denoting either bracelets or the cuffs of her jacket.   This statuette belongs to an important category of cast-bronze figures of women produced in workshops on the island of Crete between c. 1650 and 1400 BCE (2). They range from crude miniatures to figures c. 15 cm in height, such as the impressive statuette of a woman in Berlin who also holds her right fist to her forehead (3). However, she folds her left hand across her breast and bends slightly forward, producing a feeling of tense power that is lacking in the vertical stance of the Harvard statuette. The meaning of the fist-to-forehead gesture remains unclear. Most scholars have interpreted it as a ritual gesture of prayer or adoration, but there is no conclusive evidence to prove this. While it seems likely that statuettes with this gesture represent mortal women, perhaps devotees of a particular cult or priestesses, there is the possibility that at least some of them might portray goddesses. This statuette likely dates to c. 1600 to 1500 BCE, and it must come from one of the bronze-casting workshops on Crete active at this time. Where the contexts are known, these statuettes occur both in cave sanctuaries and in palace or villa sites. Other contexts will undoubtedly emerge with further excavation.     NOTES:   1. See S.

These heavy rings cannot be explained as finger rings or bracelets, nor do the find contexts suggest other practical functions. When found in burial contexts, they do not form part of the adornment of the dead. Like the oversized dress pins of the Geometric period (compare 1947.33.4), the rings appear to have been deposited in sanctuaries and graves for their metal value. It has been suggested that they constituted a pre-monetary form of currency (1). The rings in the Harvard collection do not confirm the standardized ratio of diameter to weight assumed in the relevant study. As their findspots are not known, it cannot be excluded that the one or the other was in fact a ring handle or part of a buckle. Some credibility may be given to their reported provenance from the Argive Heraeum, since three out of the four rings were presented to the museum by family members of one of the Heraeum excavators (2).

201676,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A stiffly posed rider perches on the back of a horse, which has a thin mane and raised forelock. The bearded man appears to have a standing posture, with his feet positioned perfectly flat. The precariousness of his position is counterbalanced by the reins that extend diagonally from the horse’s head to his waist-high hands. His short hair, rendered by radiating straight incisions, is bound by a deeply incised circlet, which may have originally been inlaid with another metal. His face is marked by slightly bulging eyes, a large nose, small mouth, and receding chin. The small ears, bulging eyes, and forelock of the horse’s head are executed by raised lumps. The horse’s body, legs, and tail, as well as the man’s arms, consist of simple tubular metal rods. These are given vitality through their expressive bending, as seen in the curve of the front legs, which makes the horse appear as if he were straining forward, while the man’s arms create a rounded form as he pulls up on the reins. The piece is unusual, with no exact known parallels. G. Hanfmann compares it to several bronze and terracotta specimens, placing it in the Near East in the late second or early first millennium BCE (1). He notes, however, that bronze representations of horsemen are quite rare in the Near East.

It is cast with a circular, double-stranded ring-handle that has a stirrup-like thickening at the top. This bell was excavated, alongside other bells, in a horse burial associated with a human grave at Gammai on the eastern side of the Nile in Nubia, at the Second Cataract; it clearly served as a horse-bell (1). With its characteristic handle shape, it belongs to a bell type common in the Nubian Ballana Culture and found associated with horses and camels, for example at Quostol, c. 30 miles north of Gammai (2). It is one of two bells in the Harvard Art Museums from Gammai (the other is 1924.75.B)   A large variety of shapes of copper alloy bells are known from Nubia and also from Egypt in earlier periods, at least since Dynasty 23; they served as amulets (especially for children) and animal bells, votive offerings, and musical or signal instruments in sacred contexts (3). Rare, elaborately-decorated examples from Meroe depict enemies in fetters (4), while copper alloy bowls from post-Meroitic el-Hobagi have miniature bells attached to the rim (5). The bells appear to have served a variety of purposes, notably in a cultic context and as amulets for humans and animals. Their use as part of horse harnesses—usually of rulers’ horses—appears to be a particular feature of the Nubian post-Meroitic and Ballana Cultures that survived into the medieval period (6).

211697,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This smiting figure with simple modeling has an almost flat body, while the head is cast in the round. The roughened appearance of the figure’s surface, an effect attributable to the original wax model, produces an abstract form in combination with the lack of defined musculature or clothing. The head bends slightly to the proper left, while the body sways slightly to the right at the hips. The most prominent features of the head are the large slender nose and semicircular ears that extend out perpendicularly from the head. The simplified Egyptian White Crown with flaring base and flat top suggests a creation place in the Syro-Palestinian region. The right foot is slightly forward but not fully striding, in contrast to most smiting figurines, which advance with the left foot. The front section of the proper left foot is missing, and the proper right foot lacks its heel, perhaps due to casting flaws. Both hands are clenched in fists, which are unpierced and show no sign of having held separate objects. The flat body is more typical of early second millennium pieces, yet the raised arm position appears principally in the Late Bronze Age (c. 1600-1200 BCE) (1). A group of bronze figurines with similarly flat bodies was revealed by erosion along the Orontes River in western Syria and dated close to 2000 BCE (2). The Orontes figurines, however, wear a distinctive headdress that appears as a tall spike backed by a spreading fan-like element. The Harvard piece may be dated sometime later, in the middle of the second millennium BCE.   The geographical area of the Levant, comprising the regions of present-day Israel, Lebanon, western Syria, and south-central Turkey, produced an extraordinary number of small copper alloy figurines from the end of the third millennium into the beginning of the first millennium BCE (3). Most of these figurines depict a standing male figure with left foot advancing and right arm raised in a position of smiting (4). Often the hands are pierced with holes to hold weapons or armor. These separate elements are preserved in a few examples, the most spectacular being a warrior holding a spear and shield found in a late thirteenth or early twelfth century BCE building at Enkomi on Cyprus (5). The figurines have a wide distribution, with examples found as far away as Greece, but the majority is concentrated along the Mediterranean coast of the Levant (6).   While the figurines share a common conceptual underpinning, the actual forms and styles of the small copper alloys display a remarkable range of diversity. In general, they appear to move along a spectrum from those that include a high degree of Egyptianizing elements, presumably produced in regions closer to Egypt, to those showing stronger affinities with the Hittite artistic tradition of central Turkey. Such stylistic features are evident in the shape and type of the tall crown, the form of the short skirt or kilt, and the proportions of the body. The basic iconography of the smiting figure is derived from the Egyptian image of Pharaoh defeating his enemies; yet, there is no exact parallel in Egypt, indicating a peculiarly Levantine iconographic conception. The figure most likely represents a deity, sometimes identified as either Baal or Reshep, two West Semitic gods. Although no definitive evidence exists to support these attributions, some examples have horns on their headdresses, which are a Near Eastern attribute of divinity (7). Where archaeological contexts are sufficiently well preserved, the figurines are clearly associated with cultic spaces. The largest group of excavated figurines comes from several locations in the temple complex at Byblos on the Lebanese coast, while another set was excavated in a Late Bronze Age temple complex at Kamid el-Loz in inland Lebanon (8). The precise dating of the figurines remains fraught for several reasons. First, many were hoarded and only buried well after their date of manufacture. Second, there is only poor information available, if there is any at all, on the provenience of a large portion of the figurines in museum collections. Finally, while the overall conception of the figurines unites them as a group, the diversity of individual features and styles often makes stylistic comparisons difficult.    NOTES:   1. H.

The chains attach at one end to loops, which protrude from the disc, and at the other end to the ring of a suspension hook. The disc has a geometric, openwork design composed of three concentric circles and seven round openings, one at the center and six evenly placed around the outer circle. Small conical glass beakers filled with oil and ignited by a wick would have been placed in the openings (2).   Six pairs of spokes radiate from the central opening, three of which are connected by crosspieces. The other three are partially filled. Between the six peripheral lamp openings additional spokes connect the middle and outer circles. The filled spokes create a form similar to the Greek letters Chi-Rho, Christ’s monogram. The double spokes with crossbars and the bridged spaces between lamp openings may signify the Greek letters alpha and omega, respectively (3). The design of this polycandelon combines several earlier iconographic motifs, which have lost some of their original detail and developed into more abstract shapes. A similar polycandelon, formerly in the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum, Berlin (4), comes from the Wadi Natroun monastery in Egypt, suggesting an Egyptian provenance for the Harvard polycandelon as well.   Polycandela are lighting devices, usually made of metal, that hold multiple lamps or candles in order to illuminate spaces brightly (5). Until the eighth century CE, polycandela were widely used as household furnishings (6). The Christian iconography incorporated in the design of the two Harvard examples does not preclude their use in a home, but it certainly does make them appropriate implements for a church, where they could have served as votive offerings. Byzantine churches often displayed lavish illumination schemes (7). As purveyors of light in holy spaces, polycandela facilitated a relationship between functional and spiritual illumination, a connection expressed through their incorporation of sacred symbols (8).

216269,Published Catalogue Text,1990,"Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums","147  Head from a Small Portrait, a Statue of a Woman, or a Small Statue of the Good Shepherd  The very crystalline marble is from Thasos or northwest Asia Minor. The strands of hair have been sharpened with an engraver's tool (in post-Classical times?).   The workmanship is cursory, with the features irregularly placed. The hair and the large eyes are indicated by incised lines, the latter protruding also. The mouth is wide and turned downward. Thick plaits of hair are wound around the top and back of the head, with no relation to its shape. These plaits of hair come together in a horizontal ""V"" leading to a vertical line down the middle of the back of the head.   A small statue of the Good Shepherd found in the ruins of Caesarea Maritima on the Palestinian coast gives a good illustration of how the complete figure from Daphne must have appeared. There is a second such figure, where the head is only in relief against the animal's back, from near Gaza (Vermeule, C., Anderson, 1981, p. 16, fig. 34).   As a head from a small statue of the Good Shepherd, this creation is the eastern Mediterranean successor to the first images of the youth with a ram or sheep around his shoulders. The first group came out of Hellenistic Asia Minor around A.D. 275 or somewhat earlier and gave the Bonus Pastor the idealized features of Alexander the Great. The sarcophagi of the period form A.D. 250 to 325 in Rome constitute the second group of representations of the Good Shepherd, and they include youths derived from the Alexander the Great image and those who look toward the round-faced, curly-headed types from Syrian Antioch and those from the Holy Land (Weitzmann, 1979, pp. 318-319, no. 463 and 62). When a Phrygian cap is worn, the Good Shepherd depends on the older iconography of Orpheus taming the beasts with music (Weitzmann, 1979, pp. 320-322, nos. 464-466).   An idea of when such ""Little Orphan Annie"" heads of the Good Shepherd can be dated comes from the hair and faces of the mahouts on the elephants in the diptych leaf of A.D. 431 in the British Museum, the scene depicting the consecration of a deceased emperor (Weitzmann, 1979, pp. 70-71, under no. 60). These small statues of the Good Shepherd were produced as table or shelf supports in Late Antiquity for tombs, chapels, and doubtless, household shrines, as pagan groups had been employed in earlier centuries (Ganymede and the Eagle, Bellerophon and Pegasos, etc.) (Frel, n.d., p. 38, no. V 83). There were other iconographic types used for the youthful Good Shepherd in the Latin West. A small statue found near the Aurelian Wall at the Porta San Paolo in Rome mixes the Alexander the Great ideal with third-century Greek Imperial portraiture in a head that stands forth from the sheep on his shoulder (Jones, 1912, p. 361, no. 1, pl. 93).

219622,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This stamp is very well preserved, with all edges of the stamp plate fully intact. The handle attached to the back of the plate consists of a rectangular ring with rounded edges and a circular opening. Interpuncts separate the words and abbreviations of the legible, although not fully comprehensible, text. There is no decoration on the stamp, but space has been left between the horizontal registers.    The stamp reads: PRIVATI · Q · P · M SEPTIMI · PRISCI   “Of Privatus, slave of Quintus P(?) M(?) / of Septimius Priscus.”   Each of the six Roman bronze stamps in the Harvard Art Museums consists of a plate, on which the die of the stamp is carved, and a ring, attached to the back of the plate, which serves as a handle for applying the stamp (1). With the exception of 1977.216.3250, Harvard’s stamps are approximately the same size (c. 5-6 cm long and 2-3 cm wide), and all are inscribed with text. Stamps were produced in a variety of shapes. Most are rectangular, but they could also be elliptical, circular, rhomboid, or in the shape of a tabella ansata, a foot, or, less commonly, a hand. Five of the six stamps in the Harvard Art Museums are rectangular. Four of these have two lines of writing inscribed on them; one other rectangular stamp contains a single line of text, which is limited to initials. The sixth stamp, 1977.216.1963, takes the shape of a foot and also has only one line of writing. This stamp appears to contain pseudo-alphabetic characters. Four others are inscribed in Latin, with the lettering raised and written backwards, a mirror image of the text the stamp would produce. 1977.216.3250 is inscribed in Greek letters but not written retrograde, meaning that the stamp’s impression would have been backwards.   Many types of objects in the ancient world bore stamped impressions, including amphorae, roof tiles, bricks, lamps, glass vessels, and terra sigillata (fine pottery). Textiles and bread were also sometimes stamped, and stamps like Harvard’s may have been used for such a purpose (2). Roof tiles and bricks were being stamped in Greece as early as the Archaic period. In the West, the earliest evidence for stamps comes from amphorae dated from the end of the fourth to the beginning of the third centuries BCE (3).   The texts of stamps most often refer to the name of the producer or manufacturer of the product in the genitive case (e.g., 1978.495.34 “of Cossinus Eutychianus”). In certain instances, the name is written using ligatures or abbreviations. Other stamps include an image such as a leaf (hedera) or an abstract pattern, while some stamps have writing in what seems to be an imitation of alphabetic characters, although it is clearly not Latin or Greek (4). In these cases, where the recipients of such goods were most likely illiterate, the presence of a stamp on the object may have sufficed to guarantee a certain level of quality. Stamps could have varying degrees of decoration along the border and may or may not have a horizontal element to divide separate lines of text (5). The extent a stamp was used varied according to workshop; certain workshops continued to use their stamps until the writing was no longer legible before replacing them (6).   NOTES:   1.

219624,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The large size of this elegant, hollow-cast cat statuette allowed it to hold a mummified animal in its cavity, which was reached through a large circular opening in the bottom. Although the proper left leg has a manufacturing flaw, the splendid creature bears numerous elements of ornamentation. A wide broad collar, probably originally inlaid with another metal, covers the shoulders and chest. In the center of it is a winged aegis on which a slightly redder area indicates the attachment of a central element. Faint traces of an incision reveal the presence of a pectoral hanging from the broad collar, probably in the form of the wadjet eye of Horus. Both ears are pierced, and the details of the ears and the forehead markings are inlaid with a mixed copper alloy. An abraded area on the forehead indicates where a scarab, now lost, was affixed. Four deep rectangular cavities along the end of the tail were intended for glass or faience inlays. A circular extension under the hindquarters and a large rectangular tenon below the forefeet served to attach the statue to its base.    The seated cat was the most popular animal depicted in bronze during the first millennium BCE and accompanied the increasingly widespread recognition of sacred animal cults from the Late Period through the Ptolemaic (664-30 BCE) (1). The house cat, as the domesticated counterpart to the wild feline, especially the lion, appears in Egyptian art at least as early as the Middle Kingdom (c. 2134-1665 BCE). The male, or tomcat, was associated with the sun god, and in the New Kingdom (c. 1571-1076 BCE) played an important role in the Book of the Dead as the slayer of the Apophis serpent, enemy of the sun god. In all likelihood, however, the bronze statuettes represent the female cat and are connected with a series of goddesses, in particular Bastet.   Bastet was an ancient goddess, known from at least the beginning of the Old Kingdom (c. 2687-2191 BCE). She and several other goddesses associated with the solar element were represented as feline-headed. Over time, she acquired the more benevolent characteristics of the domesticated cat, known for its fertility and nocturnal sex life, in opposition to the more threatening leonine aspects assumed by the goddess Sekhmet. In this role, Bastet and, by extension, cats were seen to be peaceful and protective. While there were other goddesses who manifested themselves as cats, for example Pakhet (“She Who Scratches”) in Middle Egypt, Bastet’s supremacy rose during the first millennium, probably as a direct result of her connection to the rulers of Dynasty 22 (c. 931-725 BCE) who came from Bubastis, the ancient cult center of Bastet.    Bubastis (modern Tell Basta near Zagazig in the eastern Delta), in addition to other Egyptian sites, became the site of a large cat cemetery at the temple of Bastet, in which mummified cats were deposited as votives. Skeletal evidence suggests that the mummified cats had been intentionally killed while still young, rather than having been cherished pets that died of natural causes (2). Small cat figurines were often wrapped in the linen bandages of the mummified remains, which were in turn placed in bronze or wooden containers in the shape of seated cats. Many of the larger, hollow-cast bronze cats can be interpreted in this way and retain an opening into the body cavity. The majority of the bronzes, however, were dedicated in shrines.   The dedication of cat mummies and votive statues has been connected to a highly institutionalized cult of the king, which may explain the large number and standardized iconography of the bronzes (3). Although there is a wide variety of types preserved, most of the bronzes achieve an anatomical correctness and express the essence of cats—haughty dignity and aloofness. They assume the seated position with head held erect and tail curled along the right side as in the hieroglyphic sign. One or both of the ears tend to be pierced, and gold hoop earrings remain on some examples. The frequent presence of a scarab beetle placed on the forehead and a pectoral on the chest suggests the protective function and solar connection of such figures.   NOTES:   1. J.

It has been partially reconstructed:  [woman’s name in nominative] [father’s nomen in genitive] [father’s demotic in genitive] [Θϒ] ΓΑTΗΡ  The stele has been considerably recut (J.

219627,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Cradling a small animal in its arm, this male figure stands solidly with both bare feet on a square base. A roughly rectangular peg extends below the base, perhaps a tang for attachment. The splayed fingers of the proportionally large left hand clasp the animal to his breast, obscuring most of the creature, although it is probably a sheep. The proper right arm extends forward from the body, its hand clenched into a fist with a hole running vertically through it for insertion of a separate object. The back of the figurine is completely flat except for a deep vertical groove, which might have secured a metal foil overlay. The piece is characterized by its oversized head, broad shoulders, and short legs. A wrapped kilt, with evidence of a vertical fringe on the left side, is bordered along the bottom by a wide decorated band. The figure, probably to be identified as a worshipper bearing a sacrificial offering, sports a short beard and a squared headdress set far back on the head. The beard and hair are rendered by faint incisions, while a triangularly hatched band sets the headdress off from the hair. The headdress itself bears an incised design, now extremely faint, that was drawn by G. M. A. Hanfmann and D. Hansen in 1956 (1).    A precise date and location for the manufacture of this piece are difficult to determine. Hanfmann and Hansen favor a date in the early first millennium BCE, linking it to reliefs from the north Syrian sites of Tell Halaf and Zincirli, while distinguishing it from the “polished and unified” style of the second millennium BCE (2). However, the early part of the second millennium, which corresponds to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000-1600 BCE), is characterized by bronze figures with flat bodies and large heads, many of which wear flattened angular headdresses (3). Of a rather different nature, but perhaps with some stylistic affinities, is the series of lead figurines produced during the first half of the second millennium in central Anatolia at sites such as Kültepe (ancient Kanesh) (4). The Harvard piece also displays some formal connections to a group of bronzes excavated at the northern Iraqi site of Nuzi (present-day Yorgan Tepe, an expedition jointly sponsored by Harvard University in the 1930s) (5). The three bronze figurines from Nuzi (associated with a single glazed terracotta figurine) present a similar flattening of the body surmounted by a large head modeled in the round (6). The Nuzi examples, which wear long robes and fold their arms against their chests, date to the time of Nuzi’s importance within the Mitannian state during the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries BCE.

221567,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The figure of a striding bull with a sun disc and uraeus between its horns refers to the cult of the bull in its association with the sun god, and by extension, kingship. The wild bull, as the embodiment of aggression and sexual potency, was incorporated into royal imagery. Although there were several bull cults throughout Egypt, the best known is that of the Apis bull of Memphis, the location of the ancient capital. From at least the First Dynasty onward, the Apis bull was associated with the king, and a yearly procession of the sacred animal celebrated its cult (1). It is known from inscriptions as the incarnation of the god Ptah and, after its death, was associated with Osiris. In later periods, particularly as the pharaonic tradition waned, the Apis bull procession grew in popularity among the common people. Only one bull at a time was identified as the sacred Apis bull, probably determined by special markings. It was kept in its own sanctuary near the temple of Ptah, and when it died, it was buried with lavish ceremony in the necropolis at Saqqara, just outside Memphis. Cambyses, the Persian king who conquered Egypt in 525 BCE, allegedly committed one of the gravest sins when he killed the Apis bull, as recorded by Herodotus (3.27-29). The Ptolemaic rulers, however, continued the tradition of maintaining the sacred bull, and its cult remained active into the Roman period.   The Late Period bronzes are highly standardized, producing the angular form of a striding bull. Herodotus writes that one of the markings found on the sacred Apis bull of Memphis was the likeness of an eagle on its back (3.28). This report finds a parallel in the markings seen on many of the bronze bull statuettes produced in the first millennium BCE, often executed in a secondary metal inlay. All such bull figurines display outstretched wings across their shoulders and haunches, although the marking can vary in terms of details, including winged discs, scarabs, and vultures. In between the two outstretched wings, across the backs, rests a rectangular saddle blanket. These markings appear on three of the Harvard pieces, clearly on 1919.525 and more faintly on 1967.11 (2). Some attempts have been made to classify the Apis bull figurines based on the covariance of the different elements, but the typology remains insecure (3).   The ears, horns, and probably sun disc on this example are broken, as is the flat rectangular base on which the bull stands.   NOTES:   1. See A.

The house cat, as the domesticated counterpart to the wild feline, especially the lion, appears in Egyptian art at least as early as the Middle Kingdom (c. 2134-1665 BCE). The male, or tomcat, was associated with the sun god, and in the New Kingdom (c. 1571-1076 BCE) played an important role in the Book of the Dead as the slayer of the Apophis serpent, enemy of the sun god. In all likelihood, however, the bronze statuettes represent the female cat and are connected with a series of goddesses, in particular Bastet. Bastet was an ancient goddess, known from at least the beginning of the Old Kingdom (c. 2687-2191 BCE). She and several other goddesses associated with the solar element were represented as feline-headed. Over time, she acquired the more benevolent characteristics of the domesticated cat, known for its fertility and nocturnal sex life, in opposition to the more threatening leonine aspects assumed by the goddess Sekhmet. In this role, Bastet and, by extension, cats were seen to be peaceful and protective. While there were other goddesses who manifested themselves as cats, for example Pakhet (“She Who Scratches”) in Middle Egypt, Bastet’s supremacy rose during the first millennium, probably as a direct result of her connection to the rulers of Dynasty 22 (c. 931-725 BCE) who came from Bubastis, the ancient cult center of Bastet.    Bubastis (modern Tell Basta near Zagazig in the eastern Delta), in addition to other Egyptian sites, became the site of a large cat cemetery at the temple of Bastet, in which mummified cats were deposited as votives. Skeletal evidence suggests that the mummified cats had been intentionally killed while still young, rather than having been cherished pets that died of natural causes (2). Small cat figurines were often wrapped in the linen bandages of the mummified remains, which were in turn placed in bronze or wooden containers in the shape of seated cats. Many of the larger, hollow-cast bronze cats can be interpreted in this way and retain an opening into the body cavity. The majority of the bronzes, however, were dedicated in shrines.   The dedication of cat mummies and votive statues has been connected to a highly institutionalized cult of the king, which may explain the large number and standardized iconography of the bronzes (3). Although there is a wide variety of types preserved, most of the bronzes achieve an anatomical correctness and express the essence of cats—haughty dignity and aloofness. They assume the seated position with head held erect and tail curled along the right side as in the hieroglyphic sign. One or both of the ears tend to be pierced, and gold hoop earrings remain on some examples. The frequent presence of a scarab beetle placed on the forehead and a pectoral on the chest suggests the protective function and solar connection of such figures.   NOTES:   1. J.

Three loops, evenly distributed around the ring, would have originally been attached to suspension chains. The center of the polycandelon is decorated with a cross, which has five additional smaller openings, one in the center and one in each arm (1). Beeswax residue found on the surface during conservation confirms that candles were employed to light this device. But the openings may also at one time have held lamps. Glass or bronze beakers with thin stems could have been used with this polycandelon (2). A simple florette decorates the center of the cross. Corrosion patterns indicate that this piece was stacked with other, similar objects, perhaps in the storage room of a church or large household. An identical polycandelon in the Louvre, Paris, is said to be from Egypt (3), suggesting a possible provenience for this object.   Polycandela are lighting devices, usually made of metal, that hold multiple lamps or candles in order to illuminate spaces brightly (4). Until the eighth century CE, polycandela were widely used as household furnishings (5). The Christian iconography incorporated in the design of the two Harvard examples does not preclude their use in a home, but it certainly does make them appropriate implements for a church, where they could have served as votive offerings. Byzantine churches often displayed lavish illumination schemes (6). As purveyors of light in holy spaces, polycandela facilitated a relationship between functional and spiritual illumination, a connection expressed through their incorporation of sacred symbols (7).

A section of the left molding of the tabula survives at the right, and part of the molding at the bottom also remains. The fragment was broken and clamped together in modern times.   The scene is that of an elephant facing left, in a struggle with lions and a woolly bull, the bull being gored by a tusk, one lion fleeing, and one lion lying dead at the lower left. The carving and parallels suggest a date in the last quarter of the third century A.D. This lid ought to have been part of a large strigilar sarcophagus with trainers encouraging lions to devour other beasts on the rectangular ends of the slightly curved front sections near the left and right ends. Such sarcophagi were partly symbolic in theme (and therefore suitable for any Late Antique pagan thinker) and partly a reflection of the many Romans involved in the Late Antique commerce in animals for urban show and pleasure hunts and combats.   The source for this composition can be found in Graeco-Roman decorative reliefs, such as the example in the Sala degli Animali of the Vatican showing an elephant goring a panther while a bull assists and three other panthers crouch in the landscape or attack the elephant from behind. The lid of the sarcophagus takes its composition from the lower register of a first or second century relief of this type (Reinach, 1909-1912, III, p. 414, no. 3).   A humped bull or ox confronts a lion in an animal paradise, in a mosaic from Antioch-on-the-Orontes (Toynbee, 1973, p. 286, pl. 143). The wild bull being captured in the ""Great Hunt"" mosaic at Piazza Armerina has similar tufts of fur on the back and legs (Toynbee, 1973, p. 150, pl. 74). And the elephant with the personification of Africa and a tigress in the apse of the same hunt has the same crisscross lines for the crinkles of the hide (Toynbee, 1973, pp. 29, 34, pl. I).

A garland wreath encircles the cross and letters; a rosette appears in each upper corner of the field. The letters are an abbreviation for the value of the weight: the Λ (lambda) and Ι (iota) represent litra (libra), or pound, and the Α (alpha) signifies the number one (3). The Harvard weight measures 325 g, an amount close to the standard for the Byzantine pound (c. 324 g) (4). The letters hang from the cross, their mass evenly distributed. In effect, the cross forms a balance, symbolically ensuring the just value of the weight.

The straight rim bears a large number of drilled holes, which may be modern. A cylindrical, brass pin currently projecting from one of them was probably a device for mounting. One side is bounded by a guilloche pattern. The other is circumscribed by a raised ridge. The central intaglio design represents Skylla (1). She raises her right arm backward, brandishing a trident. Dog heads project from beneath her waist, where her human torso joins her lower body. Scales are represented on the body, and her tail is forked at the end. Spiky fins surmount the upper part of her body. The other side has a smaller circular intaglio motif, also circumscribed by a guilloche motif, but badly corroded. Represented in the intaglio form is a Nereid mounted sideways on a hippocampus, carrying a Corinthian helmet in her right hand and a shield, with central gorgoneion, over her left shoulder. The shield appears in three-quarter view. This must be Thetis, mother of Achilles, bringing two items of the new armor that Hephaistos had made for him back to her son (2). This is part of the “Marine Thiasos,” an enormously popular subject in many media during the fourth century BCE. This may have been one intaglio in a series, each one of which would produce a relief of another Nereid bringing other pieces of the armor to Achilles. It is unclear what kind of objects would have been produced from the intaglio impressions on both sides of this object, whether they would have been relief medallions in sheet gold or silver for the interiors of dishes in precious metal or decorations for armor. Another possibility is that this object was set into a shallow circular depression in an anvil and used in combination with a punch die to strike coin-like metal objects, such as tokens or medallions.    This enigmatic matrix has attracted extensive scholarship since its first publication by D. M. Robinson decades ago. Further studies of matrices and punches for producing repoussé objects in sheet metal will undoubtedly shed further light on this important object, its functions, and its date.   NOTES:   1.

Traces of a spiky border are evident on the disc, which bears an engraving and an inscription that are probably modern. The engraving shows a female bust and a recumbent male, and the inscribed retrograde letters θfapulk * * auietruiusksinspuialleθ are arranged in an arc.    There are ten Etruscan bronze mirrors in the collection of the Harvard Art Museums, ranging in date from the early fifth century to the mid second century BCE. All the mirrors bear engraved designs, and the more elaborately decorated medallions contain scenes involving human or divine figures. Identifiable subjects include a seated Hermes and Lasa (1932.56.38), as well as two young men wearing short chitons and Phrygian caps on 1932.56.37, who may be the Dioskouroi (1). The subjects depicted on other mirrors are more difficult to identify with certainty. One such example is a scene depicting two young men flanking two women, one of whom is nude, in front of an architectural structure (1977.216.1995.A-B); it has been suggested that the figures may be Helen, Clytemnestra, and the Dioskouroi (2). Another scene, less well preserved, shows a figure wearing a peplos and helmet flanked on the left by a man in a short tunic and boots, and on the right by an unidentified woman wearing a peplos and Phrygian cap (1977.216.2311). The central figure is most likely Athena (Etruscan Menrva), and while the figure on the left leans on a club similar to the one often carried by Herakles, it is unusual for that hero to be shown clothed (3). The three stand before a two-story Ionic structure.   Two mirrors in the collection show signs of an interesting afterlife. The disc of 1977.216.2311 has been perforated in ten places, probably as a means of ensuring that the object would be useless to the living and could be permanently dedicated to the deceased; a less plausible suggestion is that the mirror was reused as a strainer (4). Another mirror in the collection (1977.216.3422), if it is ancient, seems to have been reworked in modern times by an engraver who added to the medallion a female bust, a recumbent male, and an inscription. Neither the style nor the subject of the engraving corresponds to examples known from other Etruscan mirrors, and both the engraving and the inscription appear to have been made with a modern instrument (5).

Much of the nose is restored .There are slight damages to the upper lip, the hair, and the beard. The slightly incised pupils gaze straight ahead. Hair and beard are carved out with gouges, and there are traces of the drill, especially in the latter.   Despite a relatively short reign as co-emperor with Marcus Aurelius (A.D. 161-169), Lucius Verus was a popular subject of portraiture from childhood (as son of Aelius Verus) to beyond his death (as he was deified). This head, simple and almost summary in treatment, appears to depend on models made in Greece about A.D. 161-163.The surviving Athenian versions have more drillwork and, in one instance, a fuller beard, but this may indicate a later recension. As Lucius Verus advanced in years, his hair was arranged in a larger mass of puffy curls, and his beard grew longer.   If the Sicilian provenance for the Harvard head is correct, the portrait was probably carved in a workshop on an island such as Naxos or near the Piraeus and imported into Sicily.   A battered marble bust of Lucius Verus—a masterpiece from a luxurious Roman house at Patras—was undoubtedly carved in an Attic or Cycladic workshop and gives the point of aesthetic departure from the Greek models for the head at Harvard.

Its handle is in the shape of a cross with flared arms. The arms terminate in small circles, and a finger grip is soldered to the back of the cross. The base of the lamp forms a shallow disc and is indented to receive the pricket of a stand. The spout is unusually large and displays corrosion; the body is damaged by a deep indentation near the lip of the basin. The provenience and date of this object is unknown, but similar lamps come from Egypt and have been found in contexts dating to the fifth to seventh centuries (1).   Each of Harvard’s Byzantine lamps consists of a bulbous body, spout, lid, and handle. The central cavity held oil that provided the fuel for the wick in the spout. Most of these examples were pierced at their base by a tapering rectangular indentation rising through the central cavity to receive the pricket of a stand. Although some lamps could be hung from above, all lamps in this group lack suspension rings. Instead, they were placed on a table or a stand (such as 1975.41.141.A-C). The basic form of the reservoir, handle, and spout derives from ancient Greek and Roman types, with some examples dating probably as early as the third millennium BCE.   Lamps were widely used during the Byzantine period in both sacred and profane settings. In the Christian liturgical context, lamps functioned as votive offerings, processional objects, funerary accoutrements, and lighting devices for worship. Similarly, lighting was an important component of imperial ceremonial. The use of lamps in magical rituals is also attested during the early Byzantine period (2). Many homilies and theological essays of the Byzantine period ascribe symbolic significance to lamps, for example, as metaphors for the soul (3). In the household, lamps were primarily used for illumination of domestic space, but they could also play a role in private devotional practices (4). Excavations such as those in Cyprus show that together with a table and couch, lamps were the most common household furnishing until candles largely replaced lamps by the seventh century (5).    Byzantine lamps range from strictly utilitarian examples to elaborately adorned vessels accented with crosses, animals, and precious stones. The cross and shell embellishments found in these examples mix religious and classical motifs. Clay lamps were the least expensive and most widespread, while bronze and silver appeared in aristocratic households and ecclesiastical settings (6).         NOTES:    1. Compare M.

The figure’s arms are raised with bent elbows to gracefully support a basket with a ropework base that rests upon his bald head. The figure’s clean-shaven face is broad and has rounded features, with large, almond-shaped eyes, a prominent nose, small closed lips, and large, protruding ears. A line around the torso marks the upper hem of a kilt. From this line down, the figure swells at the hips and then tapers to a blunt point forming a smooth uninscribed peg.   This object portrays a king carrying a basket of clay or other building material during his ritual participation in the construction of a royal building or temple, which is typical of copper and bronze “canephore” or “basket bearer” pegs. A late third millennium BCE text (Cylinder A) of the ruler Gudea of Lagash provides a detailed description of his active role in the construction of the Ningirsu Temple at Girsu, during which he transported material in a sacred basket that he carried “on his head like a crown” (1).    Although it is not inscribed and its original context is unknown, stylistically this peg is nearly identical to others that are securely dated to the reigns of the Ur III kings Ur-Nammu (2112-2095 BCE) and Shulgi (2094-2047 BCE) (2). Many of these pegs were found by archaeologists in boxes built into the mudbrick foundations of temples and palaces, often at the corners of buildings and flanking gateways. They were frequently accompanied by the remains of offerings or auspicious material such as beads, stone chips, and date pits, and some pegs were found with remnants of fabric clinging to them. Many boxes also contained remnants of what may have been wooden pegs as well as stone or metal tablets in the form of plano-convex bricks. The inscriptions on the tablets and on a number of pegs record the royal building of the relevant structure for the sake of a deity (3).   The resemblance of foundation figure pegs and their associated tablets to traditional building materials illustrates their role as architectural devices. Although foundation pegs had no structural significance, their presence would have contributed symbolically to the strength and security of important buildings in Sumerian cities.

Given the ring’s worn state and mediocre execution, the identity of the figure is not secure. A Ptolemaic queen such as Arsinoe II, wife of Ptolemy II, Philadelphus (r. 285-246 BCE) or Berenike II, wife of Ptolemy III, Euergetes (r. 246-222 BCE) may be represented (1). Alternatively, the woman may be a more generic representation deriving from Ptolemaic royal portraiture.

The stele is good-to-average Pentelic marble [probably not: identified as marble from Sounion by istope analysis - article in file].  The basic condition is also good, but ""all the surfaces have been more or less recut"" (J. Frel, letter of 15 June, 1973).  There are faint traces of painted egg and dart motif above the inscription.  Melisto, daughter of Ktesikrates, holds a doll in her left hand and a bird in the right, and looks down toward the furry little dog springing up at her from the right.  She wears a simple girt chiton, like a nightgown.  The deme of Potamos, whence Melisto came, was on the Attic coast, north of Sounion, south of Brauron, where statues of girls similar to this representation in relief were found in the sanctuary of Artemis. The head of a statue in this style and tradition is represented by no. 27 in this catalog [1922.72].

288564,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The brass lamp stand, made up of three pieces, has a saucer and pricket supported by a baluster-turned shaft and tripod base. The feet of the stand—in the shape of lions’ paws—are capped at the knee by the flared base of the shaft terminating in three downturned knobs. The rising shaft flares at its center. Three pairs of concentric circles are inscribed the shaft at its base, middle, and top. The middle piece (approximately 1.6 cm high) connects the tripod base to the saucer. It flares at the bottom and rises to a small disc. Unlike the upper and lower pieces, which have inscribed bands, the middle piece is decorated with a raised band. The third piece, the saucer and pricket, is joined to the middle piece by a screw. This section is inscribed with three pairs of concentric circles (at the base, under the lip of the saucer, and on the pricket) and a single, deeper circle on the upper edge of the lip of the saucer.   The tripod base and flared shaft are similar to other eastern Mediterranean examples from the fifth to seventh centuries CE (1). M. Ross attributes a similar stand in the Dumbarton Oaks collection to Syria, based on a group of stands sharing similar bases and swelled shafts (2). Chronological attribution of the group stems from inscriptions on stands from the Hama excavations (3).    This stand is made to support a lamp on its pricket. Stands varied in height from 30 cm to over a meter. The shortest were intended for tables or wall niches, and the tallest were placed on the floor. The difference in decoration, patina, and metal alloy of the middle piece compared to the other two parts of this stand suggests that the middle piece is a repair, thus precluding any estimation of the original height of the stand.

The surfaces are chipped and pitted, and there are other damages, such as to the nose, which are visible in photographs.  Almost all of the legs, save the start of the forelegs, are missing, as is the base that supported the paws.     The sphinx's head is turned at right angles to her body.  Her hair is parted in the center, and four heavy tresses fall onto her neck and right side from behind her ears.  Strong, round fillet moldings delineate the divisions of head and neck, body, and the conventional curving East Greek wings.   This statue represents the elegance of high Ionian sculpture translated into an Etruscan material and Etruscan forms of expression.  Like all of these monumental sculptures from Archaic Etruscan tombs, this sphinx was carved to be viewed from the direction to which the head is turned and to which the body runs at right angles.  The other side (left and back of the head) was finished with much less detail, suggesting that such statues were set in pairs along the dromos or over the lintel of a tomb.   While the Etruscan lions and sphinxes with heads facing ahead are free-standing entities, probably set facing each other at the entrances to the tombs, the start of the dromoi, leopards, panthers, hippocamps, and certain other real or mythological creatures share the qualities of paired mirror reversals seen in the sphinxes with heads to right or left.  Size determines which surviving sphinx might have been the pendant to the Kelekian-Robinson-Phinney-Fogg statue.  One possibility in scale and style is the fragmentary sphinx exhibited on several occasions in the possession of Munzen and Medaillen A. G., Basel, and Andre Emmerich Gallery, Inc., 1970, no. 35; Andre Emmerich Gallery, Inc., 1975, no. 37).     Among the comparable Etruscan nenfro sculptures in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the two sphinxes had their faces straight ahead, while the three leopards with head turned right (one) and left (two) were clearly designed to be set on lintels or within the confines of pediments.

ΕΙΡΗΑ ΙΣΕΙΡΗ ΝΑΙWT WΠΑΙΔ WMNIAΣ  ΠAΡIΝ (on either side of the head)   The half figure is represented with head and body shown frontally, arms firmly at the sides. The style of the child's hair suggest a date in the Hadrianic period, probably about 120 A.D.   A stele of this type is in the Archaeological Museum, Istanbul, unfortunately without provenance. An obese child's bust is shown in middle to late second or third century A.D. form, down almost to the middle of the ribcage; the bust in relief is also represented as mounted on a small plinth or large pedestal (Mendel, 1914, p. 162, no. 947). A funerary relief of Alexandros in Lieden shows a similar, half-figure bust of a boy and was brought from Thera-Santorini; it has been dated in the Roman Imperial period (Bastet, Brunsting, 1982, pp. 91-92, no. 171, pl. 46). The purpose in these reliefs is to suggest a portrait-bust of the deceased.   These half-figure busts in relief of fat little children came into the art of the Graeco-Roman Imperial East not only from Egypt or Attica, or the Greek islands, but from Roman sarcophagi created for export to all parts of the Empire, especially Macedonia and North Africa. The busts of children on the sarcophagus in Algiers, Musée National des Antiquités, from Hadrumetum and dated A.D. 225-250, bears this out (Wrede, 1981, p. 200, pls. 18, 19).

The side-locks were made separately and attached with dowels.  There is some damage, especially in the hair.  The lower part of the beard and the nose are restored.  A section of the beard below the mouth is rejoined.   This Hermes has been identified by inscriptions as a variation on two groups of sculptures (the Pergamon-Berlin series and the Ephesos-Munich-Leningrad series) with the work of Alkamenes, evidently set up on the north side of the west facade of the Propylaia (Richter, 1970, p. 182). This creation has been dated in the time of the Roman emperor Augustus (27 BC to AD 14) and shows the good, lively quality of such imperial workmanship from ateliers around Athens itself. A similar herm formerly in the art market in Lucerne suggests that here the beard has been restored with an extra lower row of curls (Ars Antiqua, A.G., 1962, p. 13, no. 49, pl. XVII); another of the Pergamene type, and with a similar, full beard, was long in the Villa Mattei in Rome (Paaribeni, E., 1981, pp. 8-84, no. 2). A herm of the type or types created by Alkamenes with such a long, ""triple-decker"" beard as restored here would probably have been confused or conflated with the bearded, draped Dionysos ""Sardanapallus"" identified with a work of Praxiteles in the fourth century BC (Johnson, 1931, pp. 33-34, no. 27).   Such terminal figures or herms, including busts rather than complete shafts, were among the ornamenta or furnishings for courtyards and gardens that Romans of wealth, like Cicero, imported from Attica and elsewhere for their town houses and country villas or estates.

The head and legs (at the feet) are broken away.  There is no indication of arms.  A groove runs between the legs, visible at the back and front.    Flat and violin-shaped, but not a ""violin idol"" since it has legs and a head, this torso has been termed Early Cycladic.  The arms are roughly indicated by a horizontal groove as being held across the front of the body.  It appears to be an idol of what is now termed the Spedos varity (Thimme, Getz- presziosi, 1977, pp. 270, 469, nos. 169, 170).     In an age where there are so many spectacular, beautifully polished or patinated forgeries of so-called Cycladic idols, the condition of the statuette and its style, as well as publication by the foremost scholar on the subject, all insure its authenticity (and the genuineness of similar survivors).  In modern museum installations the standard Cycladic statuettes are always shown as standing, but their poses, even when complete from head to toe, suggest they were made to be shown stretched out on a flat surface, as if laid out for a ""wake.""  To be sure, the flutists, the seated harpers, and the paired figures supporting a third smaller image between them are rarer illustarations of standing and seated postures, but the awkward construction of most ""idols"" is not a sign of primitivism but a product of ritual uses.  Since the giant statuettes, almost stuatues, were broken across the bottoms of the neck and the legs at the knees for placing in small, rectangular tombs, the figures were clearly created for some other purpose and afterward interred with the deceased (Vermeule, C., 1971, pp. 37-38, fig. 46; Vermeule, E., 1964, pp. 56-58).  They  were not gods, goddesses, or votaries, like statues on Cyprus from the early archaic period when Near Eastern influence was at its height onward, since they are not found in shrines.  It seems logical, therefore, that they played a part in cermonies of passage to another life and were then laid in tombs as they had been laid out ceremonially above ground.

289265,Published Catalogue Text,1990,"Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums","49  Sleeping Eros  The fragment is cut away at the top of the thighs, including the wing tips.  The left side of Eros, lying on the ground, is missing, as is the right arm at the elbow and the left hand.  There are some incrustations on the surface, especially around the head.  Drill marks are visible in the hair and other areas.   His quiver and bow beneath his cloak, which is fastened with a brooch on the right shoulder, are all on a rockwork pillow covered with the skin of the Nemean lion. This is a spirited, decorative version in marble of exceptional quality of one of the more complex Hellenistic creations in bronze or terracotta. The original was probably made in the second century B.C. This copy has been dated in the Flavian period (A.D. 70 to 98) of the Roman Empire.  Of all the various sleeping Erotes that have survived from ancient times, the bronze in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, from Rhodes, is closest to the original version, and Boethus has been suggested as the original creator, in the third century B.C.  Almost every major site with decorative sculpture in marble has yielded statues of the sleeping Eros.  All the examples at Side in Pamphylia were found in the areas around the city, indicating they were used as monuments on tombs, in the same way sleeping children and little Cupids or ""cherubs"" were placed on the graves of babies in New England cemeteries of the nineteenth century.  The symbolism went back to sculpture identified with Lysippos in the middle of the fourth century B.C. (Capitoline Eros, unstringing the bow of Herakles) and represented Love disarming Force or Strength.  Here, confident Eros sleeps surrounded by the trophies of Herakles (Inan, 1975, pp. 161-163, nos. 86-88; also Parke Bernet 4753Y, 9 December, 1981, New York, no. 236).   Thus, to recapitulate, various versions of the sleeping Eros in marble attest to the popularity of one or more Hellenistic originals, presumably fashioned in bronze, but occasionally in marble.  The bronze Eros in the Metropolitan Museum of Art has been perceived as an original creation of around 150 B.C. or earlier, one that may have inspired versions in marble, although no exact, mechanical copy has survived.  The sleeping Eros who has captured the bow or club or lionskin of Herakles is one concept that developed for somnolent little love gods from the Eros holding the bow (attributed to Lysippos) among the popular standing, genre statues of the fourth century B.C.  The Eros asleep with poppies in hand is the figure that has a more funerary implication, again the ancient equivalent of the sleeping children in classic American cemeteries like Mt. Auburn in Cambridge-Watertown.   All these small statues were created (and copied) in an age when divine (or human) child-forms were popular, and when sculptors of the late Hellenistic period were interested in new positions, new angles (as here, lying asleep) for the divine or human subject.  And, finally, a sleeping Eros must have been a popular work of art on the table at banquets of the type described by Petronius in his Satyricon or in a garden of the type commissioned by Cicero in his letters to his friend Atticus.  It is not without reason and a sense of history that the young Michelangelo's Sleeping Cupid was sold to Cardinal Riario as an ancient sculpture in marble.  The Italian Renaissance, in the traditions of Donatello's children, admired the phase of antiquity that produced these sleeping Erotes (Haskell, Penny, 1981, p. 54f).

The neck was worked for insertion in a bust.   There are a number of portraits in marble and volcanic Italian stone, of much finer quality than this example, that show the genesis of this type of face in the period of the Second Triumvirate (Schweitzer, 1948, pp. 126-127, figs. 192-196).   A head on an alien Antonine bust, the ensemble from the Villa Celimontana (Mattei) in Rome, shows how these portraits relate to the head of Julius Caesar of the type in the Camposanto, Pisa (Righetti, 1981, pp. 12-14, no. I, 11). Another head, with pupils expressed and possibly late Hellenistic rather than Flavian or Hadrianic, is the Greek Imperial counterpart of the Harvard portrait, borrowing its Italic physiognomy for the wider eastern Mediterranean world (Huskinson, 1975, p. 35, no. 65, pl. 26). Vagn Poulsen discussed portraits of this urban and suburban Roman type in connection with the head found after World War I in the Hudson River near the old Lackawanna Ferry slips (23rd Street) and now in the Milles collection in Stockholm and in connection with a head in Copenhagen. The man in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen (no. 565), has the same form of face and, if he were the same person, he is shown in an older portrait of greater quality in carving. Moreover, he seems to smile rather than to set his lips into a grimace, as does the man in the Harvard collection (Poulsen, V., 1973, I, p. 56, no. 23, pl. XXXV).

The bulbous body has a flared base with a tapering rectangular protrusion rising through it to receive the pricket of a stand, as well as a spout inscribed with a ring circling its lip. The lid is inscribed by a ring at its base, and tapers to a rounded finial. The handle is shaped like a cross with three beads decorating the upper arms of the cross and a finger ring at the base (1).   Each of Harvard’s Byzantine lamps consists of a bulbous body, spout, lid, and handle. The central cavity held oil that provided the fuel for the wick in the spout. Most of these examples were pierced at their base by a tapering rectangular indentation rising through the central cavity to receive the pricket of a stand. Although some lamps could be hung from above, all lamps in this group lack suspension rings. Instead, they were placed on a table or a stand (such as 1975.41.141.A-C). The basic form of the reservoir, handle, and spout derives from ancient Greek and Roman types, with some examples dating probably as early as the third millennium BCE.   Lamps were widely used during the Byzantine period in both sacred and profane settings. In the Christian liturgical context, lamps functioned as votive offerings, processional objects, funerary accoutrements, and lighting devices for worship. Similarly, lighting was an important component of imperial ceremonial. The use of lamps in magical rituals is also attested during the early Byzantine period (2). Many homilies and theological essays of the Byzantine period ascribe symbolic significance to lamps, for example, as metaphors for the soul (3). In the household, lamps were primarily used for illumination of domestic space, but they could also play a role in private devotional practices (4). Excavations such as those in Cyprus show that together with a table and couch, lamps were the most common household furnishing until candles largely replaced lamps by the seventh century (5).    Byzantine lamps range from strictly utilitarian examples to elaborately adorned vessels accented with crosses, animals, and precious stones. The cross and shell embellishments found in these examples mix religious and classical motifs. Clay lamps were the least expensive and most widespread, while bronze and silver appeared in aristocratic households and ecclesiastical settings (6).         NOTES:    1. Compare L. Wamser and G.

A famous head of about 50 B.C. in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen (no. 461), from Cyzicus shows the point of departure for the Harris Kennedy head, which must represent a man reasonably prominent in some municipality's affairs, or even in the political world on a broader scale from Italy to the East, at the end of the Roman Republic or the Julio-Claudian decades of the Roman Empire (Hafner, 1954, p. 48, no.

291331,Published Catalogue Text,1990,"Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums","83  Torso and Top of the Legs of a Small Statue of Sylvanus  Head, right arm above elbow, right leg from the middle of the thigh, left foot and ankle (at shoe of the boot), and lower part of the support at the left leg are missing.   This is a decorative work of the Roman Imperial period of the type perhaps to be found in a garden around Pompeii or Herculaneum. The figure was holding a large branch in his (damaged) left hand. Its top (partly missing) blossomed out into a bunch of leaves and, presumably, fruits. More fruits and flowers are visible in the ample cloak, which is pinned with a brooch on the right shoulder and hangs down the left side and back.   The figure seems too mature to be an Eros or a seasonal Genius. The drillwork in the fruits and cloak and in the pubic hair suggests a date in the third century A.D., around 250.  The prototypes for small, rustic statues of Sylvanus were based on figures of Zeus or even Poseidon or Saturn with appropriate alteration of attributes. In addition to his role as a patron of woodlands and parks or gardens, Sylvanus was much admired in the Antonine period of the Roman Empire as patron of the countryside of Italy and, eventually, under Commodus (A.D. 180-192) as a deity of the slaves (Poulsen, 1951, p. 251-252, nos. 492, 493, pl. XXXVII).   A pair of statues in Berlin demonstrate that Sylvanus can come in an unclothed version (wearing only the cloak of forest products) or clothed (a workman's tunic), depending on whether his divine or his rustic nature is stressed (Conze, 1891, p. 120, nos. 282, 283). The bodily prototypes for statues of Sylvanus varied in the Antonine period, the probable date of the Harvard figure. Hadrian had borrowed from various figures of the fifth and fourth centuries for its representations, statues and reliefs, of his favorite youth Antinous. Variations in the position of the cloak and mirror reversals in the stance are common. Compare the clean, cold torso based on Polykleitan models that was in the Ernst Brummer Collection (Galerie Koller A.G. 1979, pp. 250-251, no. 638) or the almost Severe Style torso with large cloak or goatskin of fruits suspended from the shoulders, in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston (Vermeule, C., Cahn, Hadley, 1977, p. 23, no. 29). One of the finest complete statues of the type from which the small figure at Harvard comes was found between Merida and Santiponce (Italica) in Spain and is now in the Museo Arqueologico, Madrid. The noble, wreathed, bearded head bears enough resemblance to the Emperor Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138-161) to suggest a date (Garcia y Bellido, 1949, pp. 107-108, no. 106, pl. 84).   A similar small statue, varying only in the mirror reversal of the hips, and in almost identical condition, shows by its drillwork or lack of same to have been carved in the Trajanic or Hadrianic periods (AD 100-135), if not earlier (Sotheby Sale, London, 13 December, 1982, p. 86, no. 263).

The nose and chin are damaged. The break runs across the neck just below the chin. The flesh of the face has a high polish, and there are traces of reddish color in the hair. The drill has been used at the corners of the eyes and mouth. Both ears were sketchily represented and are now damaged, especially the subject’s left ear. A dent on the back of the head could be for attachment.   This head could be from a large sarcophagus, one showing the Labors of Hercules and with the figures almost free-standing in niches. The head is certainly worked completely in the round.   The god or hero (perhaps Herakles) has the sunken eyes and upturned face of the Skopaic tradition in Greek sculpture of the fourth century B.C. There is a fillet in the form of curled strands of rope in the hair. The hair is treated in short, lumpy curls. The brows are heavy, and the neck is well muscled. The subject's left side appears to have been treated with slightly more care than the right, which might suggest the head was turned toward the viewer's left.   The tradition of representation is derived from Attic funerary and decorative sculpture around the year 200 B.C., as the seated Herakles on the left front of the relief in the Alsdorf Collection from near Syrian Antioch (Vermeule, C., 1981, p. 246, no. 206). Here the god is seated in profile to the right. The heads of Achilles and Patroklos (?) on the right short side of the high-relief Attic sarcophagus in Adana from Tarsus are nearly identical with the head at Harvard (Budde, 1964, pp. 9-26, pls. 1-14; Bielefeld, 1968, p. 354,, no. 4900).

The left arm was made separately and attached with a dowel near the shoulder. There are other minor damages and incrustation.   There are many statuettes in marble, bronze, and terracotta of the popular theme of Aphrodite tying on or adjusting her sandal. The original may have been created in western Asia Minor by one Polycharmos, but Alexandria in Egypt became a center for such productions in late Hellenistic and Roman times (Brinkerhoff, 1978, chapter iv, pp. 70-97).  A number of statuettes of Aphrodite adjusting her sandal have marine attributes or have been associated with shrines where sailors made dedications, hence the name Aphrodite Euploia (Huskinson, 1975, pp. 1-2, no. 2. pl. 1).  Such decorative statuettes, when complete, could also have erotic overtones, as the example in Berlin from Aigion, where the goddess leans on a terminal figure of the ithyphallic Priapos (Conze, 1891, p. 13, no. 23).  These small statues and statuettes also vary in anatomical proportions, the Harvard Aphrodite being plump, while an example just over twice as large emphasizes the slenderness of the figure (Galerie Koller A. G., 1979, pp. 238-239, no. 632). The statue found at Antioch-on-the-Orontes and now in the Baltimore Museum of Art also follows the slenderer, more elongated system of proportions (Brinkerhoff, 1970, p. 38, fig. 53).

291421,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Although currently mounted to serve as earrings, these pendants were produced separately, as evinced by their distinctly different metallurgic compositions and slightly varying shapes (1). Pendant B is also thicker and heavier than A. The modern date of their identical gold ear wires and copper alloy rosette-shaped fittings suggests that they were only recently united. Each earring is composed of a circular pendant with a round opening in the lower half. The resulting shape resembles a crescent, turned on its side.    A recessed tendril pattern, obscured by severe corrosion, decorates the obverse of pendant A. This ornament may imitate similar patterns found in enamel plaques set in comparably shaped gold pendants (2). The reverse of pendant A is undecorated. A small, solid tab protrudes from the bottom, and a small suspension loop projects from the top.   Both the front and back surfaces of pendant B are obscured by corrosion, and no decoration is visible. Like pendant A, pendant B has a tab protruding from the bottom, but the tab is pierced. A second hole is visible just above the circular opening. These piercings suggest that B may originally have had smaller pendants suspended within the circular opening and hung from the tab. A loop projects from the top of pendant B.   Comparably shaped, but more elaborately worked, crescent pendants in gold and enamel have been dated to the eleventh century and ascribed to both Fatimid Egyptian and Byzantine origins (3). A bronze crescent pendant that resembles the Harvard pendants but lacks the lower tab was excavated at Corinth and dated not later than the twelfth century (4). An undated bronze pendant from Egypt currently in the Awad Collection, Cairo, has a round opening like pendant B and is decorated with a relief design similar to pendant A (5).   NOTES:   1. The oval opening in the lower half of pendant A measures 1.4 by 1.8 cm; that of pendant B is round, with a diameter of 1.7 cm.    2.

There are damages to the upper fillet molding, to the thin fillet at the right end, and to the broader, lower fillet.  Although dated in the sixth century, it is equally likely a work of the fifth century. This block is the right section of a longer frieze or panel, the first scroll at the left having been continued on the adjoining section. The enrichment is a flattened, only somewhat stylized version of good Roman Imperial frieze decoration going back to the age of the Ara Pietatis Augustae in Rome, the reign of the Emperor Claudius (A.D. 41—54). A continuous acanthus scroll forms three major loops from left to right, the missing section of leaf curling into the first half-scroll seems to end in a leafy bud not unlike an artichoke. The acanthus leaves vary in their manner of carving, sometimes being almost incised.   Acanthus of similar style and quality is seen on a section of frieze from El Bahnassa with a deer at the left and the young Herakles advancing to the right, club in hand (Eisenberg, 1960, pp. 24, 26, no. 34, fifth to sixth centuries A.D.). An earlier, or perhaps nearly contemporary version of the Harvard frieze comes from a church at Ahnas (Ahnas el-Medineh = Herakleopolis) and has been dated around the year A.D. 400 (Strzygowski, 1904, pp. 48-49, no. 7306, fig. 57, see also pp. 49-50, no. 7308, fig. 59).   The right end of a limestone frieze in Mr. Hagop Kevorkian's possession in 1941, also said to be from Bawit, and dated around A.D. 500 (H. 0.31 m, W. 1.50 m), is fairly close to the corresponding section of the Harvard carving (Cooney, 1941, p. 26, no. 52, illus.). (In 1975 approximately 156 fragments of Coptic architectural sculptures in relief from the collection of Hagop Kevorkian came to the Harvard University Art Museums.

The bottom has been cut away, as if the capital has been reused in a smaller setting.   At the time of acquisition or soon thereafter, the pilaster was said to have derived from the Ara Pacis Augustae. The Corinthian pilaster capitals on the outside precinct wall of the Ara Pacis, however, have broader, flatter leaves, without the bullet-shaped vertical cuttings and with less complex stems. The fragments of the internal pilasters were quite different (Kähler, 1963, pp. 66-69, pl. on p. 68; Moretti, 1948, I, p. 113, pl. E [general view as reconstructed], pp. 168-171).   The date of this pilaster capital would seem to be in the second century A.D., and stylistic details are similar to those of the capitals at the Forum Baths of Ostia (Heintze, 1971, pp. 59-60, pl. 56). On the Pantheon capitals the leaves have fan patterns, while the Harvard capital has more parallel channels (see generally, Heilmeyer, 1970, pl. 55). The detailing of the Forum of Trajan anticipates this pilaster capital (Heilmeyer, 1970, pl. 52); in turn the Temple of Vesta in the Forum anticipates Severan details (Heilmeyer, 1970, pl. 59).

291724,Published Catalogue Text,1990,"Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums","142  Head of a Bearded Man  The head is a badly battered masterpiece. Most of the nose, the areas of the eyes, the ears, and the lower part of the beard around the chin are missing or damaged. Where preserved, the surfaces are in excellent condition, characterized by the beautiful, high polish of the skin.  This powerful countenance has a superficial resemblance to several portraits identified as the Emperor Macrinus (A.D. 217-218) or, possibly, a high official of around A.D. 243. In the Harvard portrait, however, the forms are more solidified and the treatment of incised and sculpted hair is more pronounced and beautifully handled yet entirely devoid of life. This confirms a date near the last years of the Emperor Gallienus (A.D. 260-268) or even into the following decade.  Both quality and condition have given this Roman portrait public popularity and scholarly attention, as the long list of exhibitions monographs, and articles suggest. Professor Hanfmann discovered the head in the basement storage of Harvard's Busch-Reisinger Museum, lying among the large lot of medieval and other, mostly architectural fragments purchased in New York a few months previously at the epic, four-part sale of the famous dealer Joseph Brummer's stock. The head's debut was in the 1950 exhibition of Ancient Sculpture that Professor and Mrs. Hanfmann arranged with the graduate students in ancient art. Full publication came in Professor Hanfmann's Latomus XI monograph, where the portrait was placed in the time of Valerian or Gallienus (A.D. 253-260, 260-268). The catalogues of two major exhibitions, Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, 1968-1969, and the Ackland Art Center, University of North Carolina, April 5-May 17, 1970, confirmed these dates, with minor variations. Vagn Poulsen in 1974 was the scholar who first mentioned Macrinus; the debate has continued and will do so.  The use of Luna or Carrara marble localizes the portrait in the Latin West, presumably Italy. As emperor (A.D. 217-218), Macrinus never came closer to Rome than Chalcedon on the Bosphorus where he was overtaken by the soldiers of Elagabalus (A.D. 218-222) and killed, but he did have an extensive Roman Imperial coinage, and so his image was available in Italy. All this throws smoke in the face of the fact that the Brummer-Harvard portrait combines a type of ""barbered head"" with ""plastic accentuation of each curl"" (of the lower beard) (noted by Charlotte Robl, Ackland Art Center, 1970) which can only belong to the decades of transition to the Late Antique. Although more sensitive in spirit than the numismatic portraits of Claudius II (A.D. 268-270), Aurelian (A.D. 270-275), or Probus (A.D. 276-282), tough soldiers all, similarities in hair and beard have led to the date proposed here. The subject was a private person, like the men of success and intellect represented on the big sarcophagi of the time.   Cornelius Vermeule and Amy Brauer",NULL,NULL

The fragment is broken down the left side of the Eros. His right arm is broken off just above the elbow. The right leg from above the knee is missing, and the left leg is almost obliterated.   The winged Eros moves to the right, tossing his head backward and laughing. His arms were probably stretched out in front of him. His hair is long and curly, and is gathered in a knot at the top and tied. The drill has been used liberally in the pupils of the eyes, hair, mouth, nostrils, and wing. The head of Eros is based on a type created about 200 B.C. and connected both with the statue of the child squeezing a goose, identified with Boethus, and with the groups of Eros and Psyche, the latter a century later (Ars Antiqua A.G., Auktion 7, Lucerne, 2 May, 1959, p. 15, no. 34, pl. 21).   At the left of the Eros, where the corner turned to start the left end of the sarcophagus, an animal's paw appears in low relief, at the bottom. This sphinx or lion or griffin paw rests on rocky ground, and there are traces of the creature's head above the paw.  This appears to be a section of a sarcophagus showing Erotes with the arms of Ares rather than a garland sarcophagus, or one with imago clipeata, with Erotes supporting the fillets of the festoons or the setting for the shield. Although near the left front corner of the sarcophagus, the pose of Eros is that of supporting an imago clipeata (a portrait-bust in or on a shield) or an inscribed plate (Hanfmann, 1951, II, p. viii, no. 29 in the illustrations, and fig. 32, no. 530, in Pisa).    There are a number of sarcophagi with Erotes or children engaged in athletic pursuits which show their subjects in similar poses (Vermeule, C., Cahn, Hadley, 1977, pp. 49-50, no. 68). And on a sarcophagus in the Musée du Louvre, Erotes stand also frontally, turned slightly inward, and hold the ends of fillets that extend toward two larger, flying Erotes who support a Gorgon shield in the center. The positions of the hands of these smaller Erotes could postulate a similar role for the fragment in the Harvard Museums (Reinach, 1897-1930, I, p. 80, nol. 2). On a flying Erotes with imago clipeata sarcophagus from ancient Osca (modern Huesca) in Spain, the smaller Eros on the left front is in a pose similar to that of the Harvard fragment, and he is playing the double flutes (Garcia y Bellido, 1949, pp. 280-283, no. 277, pl. 232).   Sarcophagi showing Erotes carrying the arms and armor of Ares offer the best suggestions for the origins of this fragment. The figure on the left front is usually extending his arm to grasp a spear, often held by the Eros just beyond him. There are examples in the Uffizi and the British Museum (Reinach, 1909-1912, III, p. 26, no. 5; II, p. 471, no. I, holding the spear across his chest).   Finally, there is at least one sarcophagus in which an Eros is precisely in this pose can support an imago clipeata on the left front end. It is, or was, in the Mattei collection, and three imagines are shown flanked by four Erotes (Reinach, 1909-1912, III, p. 297, no. I).   Cornelius Vermeule and Amy Brauer",NULL,NULL

The entire profile is flat and two-dimensions. The eyes are large and bulbous, and the nose is indicated by both modeling and incision.  The mouth is incised. Two diagonal indentations between the round part of the face and the neck are intended to suggest the chin.   The crudeness of this head might speak of the transition from the end of the Stone Age to the early Bronze Age in Helladic, Cycladic, or western Anatolian land.  It might also speak of something later but rustic in style and origin, rather than some work of the Christian Dark Ages or a modern village's idea of what Early Cycladic art should be.  Compare this with the unusual male (?) head published in a Basel collection and its documented parallels, although the latter has a triangular face, ending with a very pointed chin (Thimme, Getz-Preziosi, 1977, pp. 234, 440-441, no. 76).

The tip of the nose is broken away, and there is a chip above the break at the front of the neck.  The hair, treated in heavy, ""bear's-tooth"" locks, has been cleaned of root marks, traces of which survive on all surfaces.   The prototype belongs to the period about 400 to 350 B.C.  This copy would seems to date in the Julio-Claudian period, perhaps about AD 50.  Most critics have treated this head as if it were a Greek original, part of an athletic or divine statue leading to the world of the Hermes of Praxiteles.  Scholars who have questioned the head's authenticity have generally looked to the cleaned qualities of the surfaces and the shiny, heavily crystalline qualities of the marble from the island of Thasos.  The head is most likely an early Imperial copy or adaptation of a statue, probably in bronze, of which few other versions have surfaced.     A.W. Lawrence wrote that this splendid head ""has a forcefulness unknown in the fifth century, the result of minor innovations in the treatment of details; the lower part of the forehead bulges rather more, the inner corners of the eyes are more deeply set and the eyes themselves are narrower.  It is, however, an unpleasant expression that results from the attempt to gain intensity of gaze by these means"" (Lawrence, 1972, p. 182).     A head exhibited at the Royal Academy, Burlington House, when in the collection of Colonel F. Beddington, was published as a carving of about 150 BC in the school or wider circle of Lysippos.  This athlete, with the swollen ear of a boxer, must be a Julio-Claudian copy of some statue set up late in the fourth century B.C.  The head is not a replica of, only a parallel to, the Sachs athlete at Harvard, but it shows how and from what traditions such variations on Greek athletic art of the fourth century BC could survive (Chittenden, Seltman, 1947, p. 37, no. 165, pl. 53).

The head and the arms from the edges of the tunic were made separately and joined with dowels or pins.   This lady in Thracian garb could be a late version of an Amazon, but single statues in this costume usually represent Artemis Bendis who, from the fourth century B.C. onward, at least, was worshiped in the greater Athens area, chiefly on the way to the Piraeus where Thracians were settled.

The back of the head is flat, as if possibly split off from a relief. The surfaces are smooth and worn and the marble is discolored.   The woman's hair is parted in the center and drawn back over the ears. The fillet runs across the brow, under the hair.   A head in the National Museum at Athens, identified as Ariadne and seemingly of the time of the young Alexander the Great, gives a good idea of the general prototype for this head.  The Ariadne in Athens was discovered on the south slope of the Acropolis in Athens (Lawrence, 1927, p. 13, pl. 10 C).   A head in Berlin, from the Riccardi collection in Florence, has been related to another copy in the Palazzo Ducale, Venice, and then to the head in Athens.  It is suggested that there was a monument to Dionysos and Ariadne in the Street of the Tripods at Athens, from which all these heads derived, the Acropolis head being the original or very close to it (Blumel, 1938, pp. 32-33, no.

The use of the drill is evident in the beard, hair, mouth, and eyes. The marble has considerable crystalline structure.   The head is seemingly from a high relief. The style places it with sculptures from western Asia Minor, and the date ought to be ca. A.D. 150-175. The subject could be Zeus, including Ammon, Asklepios, or perhaps Poseidon. There is a suggestion of the horns of Ammon in the way the hair curls out on either side of the eyes with their incised pupils. A late Hellenistic, more classical model for this head, with subdued hair, was evidently found on Crete and may have had the outer parts of hair and head finished in plaster or even wood (Schefold, Cahn, 1960, pp. 280, 283, no. 391).   Maxwell L. Anderson has pointed out, after detailed study of this head, that it could come from a free-standing statue of the thin type popular at the outset of the late Antique period in Graeco-Roman art. He cites Vatican, Museo Gregoriano Profano inv. 10265, ""which is almost identically flat on the back, but is clearly from a free-standing statue of Asklepios."" He also adduces the example of Kassel SK 86, a Roman Imperial version of an Asklepios of the fourth century B.C. He suggests the complete statue would have been some 1.75 m in height.   This head, with its curls seeming to flatten out sidewise, may have once formed one half of a double herm, similar to the Ammon and Dionysos in Berlin (Conze, 1891, p. 10, no. 11). Otherwise, the Harvard head has a decorative frontality that brings to mind the head of older bearded divinities in the center of architectural tondi or the coffering of florid ensembles of carving of the type found in the theaters of Asia Minor in the Antonine period, Side in Pamphylia offering a good example. An indicator of the stylistic source for and the date of this fragment can be found in comparison with the portrait of a young lady, veiled, from a large Asiatic sarcophagus, a fragment from the bed of the Pactolus River at Sardis, Turkey (Hanfmann, Ramage, 1978, pp. 134-135, no. 180, fig. 328).   The imaginative curls of the hair contrasted with the flattened beard make this head a later, Asiatic parallel to the head of the bearded god (perhaps Oceanus, based on a Zeus or Poseidon of ultimately Pheidian type) in the decorative shield reconstructed from fragments of the flanking colonnade of the Forum of Augustus in Rome, dated 10-2 BC (Boethius, Ward-Perkins, 1970, p. 191, pl. 108). In the Antonine period, there is the imago clipeata of the oak-wreathed Zeus in Copenhagen, from Venice (Poulsen, 1951, p. 363, no. 520a, pl. IX). A less sophisticated, carefully worked imago clipeata bust of Zeus, from Rome, is in Berlin (Conze, 1891, p. 381, no. 938). A console with ""Caelus,"" also in Copenhagen, can be adduced; it comes from Rome (Poulsen, 1951, p. 214, no. 289a, supplement, pl. v).   The architectural enrichment of the great Hadrianic to early Antonine theater at Side is actually very sober and classicizing when compared with the carving of the middle-Antonine (Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, c. AD 163) theater at Aspendus. Architectural carvings related to, but earlier than the Harvard Museums' fragment include the busts of Artemis and Demeter in the ceilings of the decorative aediculae of the theater's scaenae frons (Müfid, 1963, pp. 136-137, figs. 112, 113).   Yet another possible origin for this fragment, or at least, a related but presumably earlier sculpture is the figure of Atlas found near Seville in Spain and in the Museo Arqueologico there. The small statue of the giant with his head, shoulders, and hands supporting his globe was dedicated to the Emperor Claudius in the year 49 A.D.

The top to a slightly diagonal line across the back of the head appears to have been finished in another material or covered with plaster or a veil. The break at the back is flat, slightly irregular, and the break across the neck is more irregular.    The head is almost certainly a Roman copy of the first century A.D. from (or of) a Hellenistic statue of about 200 B.C. The hair is parted in the middle and waved. The features are rather flatly modeled, the face being almost diamond-shaped, the eyes dreamy, the nose pointed and the lips generously curved.   One can see the model of a major Pergamene image in the manner of the fifth century B.C. for this head. The overlifesized head of Hera or Demeter given to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, by the symphony conductor Hans von Bulow in 1889, shows the Pergamene intermediary between the Lowell head and Pheidian images of the fifth century B.C. (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 58, no. 90). A mannered version of this type of head combines both the elements of the fifth century B.C. and the softening influences of Praxiteles around 350 B.C., all put together in the late Hellenistic period and then copied for decorative purposes under the Flavians or Trajan, that is, from about A.D. 70 to 115 of the Roman Empire. The copy in the Museum of Art of the Rhode Island School of Design was found in Rome about 1926 (Ridgway, 1972, pp. 71-72, 189-192, no. 27). A more animated, more Pergamene head of this general type, a Roman copy slightly larger than lifesize and therefore based on a cult image, seems to have come from Italy, probably the area around Rome, and is in the Wellesley College Museum of Art (Vermeule, C., Vermeule, E., 1972, p. 282, illus.).   Small heads of this general type and in this style of carving have been found among the late Hellenistic sculptures of Delos. When bodies have been preserved, they range from Artemis with her stag to sandal-binding Aphrodites (Marcadé 1969, pls. XLI-XLVII).

Alternatively, the head may have been part of a figure of a heroic warrior, a mythological subject like the companions of Odysseus at Speralonga or an idealization from actuality.  The last suggestion could include barbarian allies of Alexander the Great or one of the peoples (the Pisidians) who fought against Macedonian and Greeks in Asia Minor.  The former suggestion embraces the Trojan Wars, where various races fought.  The head is a splendid over-lifesized copy of the late first or second century AD, in the Hellenistic tradition, made by sculptors perhaps from Aphrodisias in Caria, after an original probably in bronze, or perhaps in colored marble, since the eyes were made separately.  This concept radiates the power of Pergamon and shows how widespread was the varied art generated by that hilltop city in northwest Asia Minor.  A partial glimpse of just one figure from what was undoubtedly a dramatic group, the muscular brow below masses of thick, undercut curls, demonstrates just how much Pergamene art took from the athletic sculpture of Skopas in the fourth century BC, figures like the original of the Harvard Meleager.  This fragmentary head also reveals the additions Pergamene and Rhodian or Carian sculptors imparted to the fourth-century ideal, creating a force referred to again and again in the arts until the Middle Ages.

There are several possible explanations for the unusual condition of the thumb and four fingers of this right hand. The hand may have been covering the body in a gesture of modesty, and the sculptor may have cut back the fingers because he miscalculated the position of the right arm. Similarly, the hand may have been holding and partly concealed by a heavy set of tresses. For this reason, also, the fingers and thumb might not have been finished.

The most famous statue of this general type is the Aphrodite in the Museo Nazionale, Syracuse (Winter, 1898-1902, p. 380, no. 2). Statuettes of this type in marble often have heavy, molded plinths and smaller figures of Eros or Priapos as part of the support at the left side of the goddess.

A single figure or a monumental version of a statue related to forerunners of the well-known group of the satyr wrestling with a hermaphrodite. This head, and its complete figure, seems to have been carved in the second century of the Empire. It features more idealization than do the commonest versions of the groups involving a hermaphrodite in compromising poses, and this head might come from a separate, more ideal and reposeful statue of a nymph or a hermaphrodite. Graeco-Roman copyists offer numerous instances of statues produced independently from groups, with appropriate changes or simplifications, to create a free-standing, decorative figure for an urban courtyard or a rural villa with park or garden.   A small statue, with a restored head, of a hermaphrodite holding Eros found in the ruins of a villa near Rome, shows the type of free-standing, decorative statue from which this head could have come. Such statues were carved in Athens and the Greek islands for export to the country seats of Italy (Jones, 1912, p. 181, no. 109a, pl. 42).   The more vulgar Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman heads, with the thick hair of satyrs and the puffy cheeks of a baby, are also found together with satyrs or Pan grasping them and as free-standing figures. An example in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, has a large wreath of vine leaves and grapes in the hair, suggesting a young maenad rather than a hermaphrodite. Like the Harvard head, this example is slightly larger than many of the surviving groups and fragments thereof, which were set in the gardens of Graeco-Roman houses and in the niches of baths and gymnasia (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 126, under nos. 194, 195). In general, when grouped together the childlike nymphs grasp their satyrs by the hair while the hermaphrodites shove them in the face (Ridgeway, 1972, under no. 23, pp. 63, 64, 178-180).

Since the copy of the Meleager attributed to Skopas in the Berlin Museum was found in the same Roman villa at Santa Marinella as the Forbes-Webster copy, it is understandable that an Antonine decorator or collector would go one step further and commission a copy in mirror reversal.  This was done for other popular copies after famous statues of the fourth century BC, notably the Weary Herakles after Lysippos (Vermeule, C., 1980 pp. 328-329).

A head of Sarapis of this type and only slightly larger in size, said to have been found in Rome and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, was even carved in red jasper (Richter, 1954, p. 90, no. 165, pl. cxviii).   Small statues of Sarapis (or busts based on such images) were often made of various materials--white marble heads and black schist or red porphyry bodies--to reflect the chromatic effects of the original image in the torch-lit recesses of its temple. Priests of the Graeco-Egyptian cults of Alexandria, principally Sarapis and Isis, fanned out all over the Roman Empire carrying such little busts and statues as far afield as the Mithraeum in London. A splendid small bust in alabaster dates to the years A.D. 117-138 and is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (Hoffmann, 1970, pp. 72-74 under no. 22). Small statues, both in white marble (Luna and Parian), in the Liverpool collections give good illustrations of the seated Alexandrian cult image (Ashmole, 1929, pp. 21-22, nos. 38, 39).   A head in Kassel, dated in the second century AD, has been termed Zeus and shows the same style, on a larger scale, as the head at Harvard (Bieber, 1915, p. 21, no. 25, pl. XXIII). Another head of Sarapis, sold in Lucerne, is identical in style with the Harvard example and is more complete, the ends of the beard, neck, and bust being preserved (Ars Antiqua A.G., Auction v, 7 November, 1964, p. 7, no. 9, pl. v). Such heads could also be used for Graeco-Roman statues of river gods, perhaps Father Nile but probably also local streams, as an example in Bologna.   Cornelius Vermeule and Amy Brauer",NULL,NULL

The folds of drapery, as preserved, are deep and fall in such a way as partly to cover the back of the bird. The ensemble stands on a plinth about .025 m thick or deep. A portion of the fragment is smoothed down one edge, but this contour has been left unmodeled.   The piece may have been part of a draped support or even a draped herm attached to the statue.

The piece of marble may have been reused, or the carefully cut-out area on the lid may have been designed for some form of vertical attachment, perhaps a cross. Some such reliquaries have a depression in the gable of the roof or an opening for pouring a libation. They were often used for the relics of saints as well as the cremated remains of loved ones. This example may have had decoration painted on the outer surfaces. A similar marble reliquary chest from under the altar of a ruined sixth-century church near Varna (Odessos) in Bulgaria had relics, perhaps of the True Cross, in a gold box set with precious stones insides a silver sarcophagus of traditional Attic shape, all placed in the marble chest with its gabled lid (Weitzmann 1979, pp. 631-633, under no. 569).

The surface of the face is badly damaged, including the nose, lips, left eyebrow, cheeks, and chin, also left brow. There are marks of the drill.   The head is frontal; the waved hair starts far back on the wide, high forehead. The type seems to be ideal rather than specific, and it recalls both the draped girls of Attica around 340 B.C. and Eros with the bow, identified with Lysippos about the same time or as late as 330 BC. The Roman version of the Lysippic Eros in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore, shows that the young god's face is thinner and the features sharper (Bieber, 1961, p. 38, fig. 88).   The same ambivalence as to sex, girl or boy, seems to exist in connection with a Head of a Boy, dated in the fourth century B.C., at Johns Hopkins University. The parallels for this Baltimore head are also with the ""little bears"" (Arctoi) from the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron, but the famous Eros with the bow by Lysippos has been shown to have represented the next stage of development in representations of children in the fourth century B.C. (Williams, 1984, pp. 20-21, no. 6). Since the Lysippic Eros is known only from Graeco-Roman marble copies and since the Harvard head seems to be related but individual as a head of a girl or boy, it seems safest to class this sculpture as work of the Roman Imperial period. The sculptor of this child was certainly influenced by the art of the fourth century B.C., and a divine child (like the baby Dionysos) may have been intended.

This small head appears to come from a draped figure of a Hellenistic type based on fourth century B.C. models and used, inter alia, for Muses. The hair is tied around the top of the head with two rudimentary fillets, one of which extends to tie up the bun at the back of the head. The face provides a very distant echo of the style of Skopas.  An Aphrodite with a small Eros on her left arm, a late Hellenistic variant of the draped ""Venus Genetrix"" type, was found together with an inscribed base ""To (the) Syrian Aphrodite,"" at the shrine of Ptoan Apollo in Boeotia; the head is in a class with this small example (Sotheby Sale, New York, 16 May, 1980, lot 264). The so-called ""Daughter of Asklepios"" of about 270 B.C. from the Asklepieion of Kos, in the Landesmuseum at Stuttgart, is turned in the opposite direction and looks more decidedly upward but gives a frame of reference for what is seen in this small head (Schefold, Cahn, 1960, pp. 470-471, no.

There is also chipping on the eyebrows, forehead, chin, and right cheek. A drill has been used in the hair, corners of the mouth, and eyes.   This is probably a Greek Imperial work of the third century A.D. The heavy hair is drawn over the ears to form a knot at the back of the neck. She wears a fairly high crown with a flat top, decorated in relief with a running design (a wide rectangle with a semi-round, arched niched in the center). The modeling is broad in the contours of the face.   The crown is a stylized view of the gate and external arcades of a city wall, of the type seen in the reconstructions of the Palace of Diocletian at Split. Such urban and regional personifications have a long history in Graeco-Roman art, going back to the Tyche of Antioch in the early Hellenistic period. Roman reliefs (Louvre), statues (Liverpool), and Late Antique silver statuettes (British Museum) show the various figures that could have heads such as this (Toynbee, 1934, pp. 7-23, pls. XXI, XXIV, XXVII-XXX; Ashmole, 1929, pp. 23-24, no. 42, pl. 27, as Phyrgia).    The lack of angle to the head in relation to the neck shows that this head came from a standing or seated figure in frontal pose, not a figure based on the many later versions of the Tyche of Antioch. Such statues existed in every city of the Greek Imperial world, as coins confirm, and they were often gilded for admiration and transport on ceremonial occasions. A head, identified as Cybele or Tyche, must have belonged to a temple statue in the agora area of Corinth; it is, although fragmentary, a more academic version of the same head as that in the Harvard University Art Museums, both based generally on the art of the fifth century B.C. It is impossible to tell whether the head is from a standing or seated image (Johnson, 1931, pp. 46-47, no. 54). Cyrene has yielded a number of such geographical heads, one especially like the Harvard example (Paribeni, E., 1959, p. 147, no. 429, pl. 185, and nos. 425-428, pls. 184, 185).

The lion is crouching on a flat surface, which seems to be finished in a slightly curving fillet, probably indicating the edge of a lid. This would place the lion on the right front or left rear corner of a gabled ""Greek"" sarcophagus or large urn. There is a further section of flat, finished surface at the animal's left side.   On an early Roman imperial cinerary urn in Malibu, four small lions (similar to this fragment) crouch facing outward to the long sides at the corners of a very elaborate, temple-form roof with a ridge-pole and imitation covering tiles all in marble. The ends of the body have Hellenistic funerary portals in the tradition of tombs from Asia Minor and Macedonia (Vermeule, C., Neuerburg, 1973, pp. 38-39, no. 86). Other elements are taken from Campanian painting or mosaics (birds drinking from kraters) and Pergamene buildings (capitals and pilasters), all suggesting that the little lions came from a mixture of decorative details remembered as far back as the Alexander sarcophagus from Sidon. Indeed in this vein, back around 400 B.C. four such lions crouch on special little plinths and face outward, again near the corners of the long sides, on the lid of the so-called Lycian sarcophagus from this same Phoenician royal necropolis (Hamdi Bey, Reinach, 1892, pl. 14; Reinach, 1909-1912, 1, p. 409, and accessible full view of the side and lid with the two lions).

He has ample hair combed forward from the top of his head to the broad band or fillet, and somewhat archaistic, almost corkscrews curls around the forehead from ear to ear.   This fragment appears to have formed the upper part of a small decorative herm with a flat back to the head, shoulders, and shaft below. Such decorative sculptures were applied to the sides of doorways, niches, and elsewhere in Hellenistic and early Roman Imperial houses. A number of such sculptures, although in a more naturalistic Italic style, have been found in the houses at Pompeii.    A head of this type, clearly a Dionysos with a full, corkscrew beard and the ends of the fillets hanging like goats’ ears form the sides beyond his real ears, has been combined with an erotic scene on a two-sided, decorative relief of the Roman period form Cyprus (Karageorghis, 1984, pp. 214-217, pl.

The low relief carving on the front consists of the right corner of a pediment with a stylized akroterion (mostly broken away) above.

Near mirror reversals of the type were created in late Hellenistic times and also copied.   She appears to have been represented as unveiling herself. She stands with the weight on her right leg, her hip thrown outward to give the body a strong S-curve. Her cloak starts behind the neck, falls down her back, and is bunched in folds on a line around the right hip to the front of the torso, falling again over the left thigh.

The presence of the diadem favors the identification as a goddess born from the sea rather than a nymph of the ocean or water.   The original statue was perhaps a bronze, but, like the Aphrodite of Knidos, it could have been a marble.  The copy in the Galleria of the Museo Capitolino, slightly larger than most, has been transformed into a statue of a Roman lady of Domitian's time (AD 81-96) wearing her high, exaggerated hairstyle and sandals on the feet.  This amusing distortion of the ultimate original may have served as a funerary statue, having been found outside the Porta San Sebastiano in an area where funerary monuments could take on what we would consider surprising pagan forms (Jones, 1912, pp. 127-128, no. 34, pl. 25).  A statue in the Museo del Prado, Madrid, in about the same state of preservation as the Harvard statue, of uncertain provenance (perhaps Roman Hispania), demonstrates the widespread export of the type (considering Smyrna as the source of the statue acquired by Edward Forbes for Harvard University) (Blanco, 1957, pp. 71-72, no. 95-e, pl. xxxviii).  A statue similar to the Forbes example was photographed in Zurich in a private collection, in 1962.  The draped and diademed head is preserved.  The provenance was said to have been the environs of Rome.   Cornelius Vermeule and Amy Brauer",NULL,NULL

The left edge seems slightly irregular also. The horse's head is abraded, and the forelegs are missing, as is the lower part of the right hind leg and the rider's right arm. Overall pitting, indicating extensive water damage. Area behind the rider is worn through.   He wears a tunic belted at the waist, an undergarment to the thighs above the knees, and a cloak pinned at the right shoulder, flying out behind. The fillet in his hair was perhaps once painted (?) and might suggest a ruler (?). There is a fillet molding below. The horse prances to the right, rearing back slightly on the hind legs and with tail flowing out and down toward the groundline of the molding below.   Comparison with the equestrian figures on the so-called Alexander sarcophagus, as well as details of the head of the Harvard relief, strengthen the suggestion that this is a commemorative representation of a Hellenistic ruler, one of the successors to Alexander the Great. Coins indicate he is Demetrios Poliorketes of Macedonia, Greece, and western Asia Minor (306 to 286/2 BC). The head can also be brought into comparison with the full-sized, free-standing head of a draped portrayal, seemingly of Demetrios I Poliorketes, in the Smith College Museum of Art, an ideal portrait perhaps copied from the equestrian statue discussed below (Hadzi, 1964, pp. 38-39, no.15) Many coins confirm the identification, showing that, as the young Macedonian king grew older, his nose became sharper and his jaw heavier. Some votive marbles traditionally do not have the details of physiognomy found on coins. The nose of the rider in the Forbes relief has lost its tip, as is so often the case with figures in Attic funerary and votive marbles, but the strong one to three o'clock angle of the nose remains in the sculpture, just as it appears on the coins. Compare, inter alia, the silver tetradrachm struck at the Pella mint from about 289 to the autumn of 288 BC, where the diadem is visible as well as the bull's horns, which are not present in the reliefs but can be seen in the Forbes marble.   ""Demetrios the Besieger"" had a bronze equestrian statue in Athens, dated 303-302 BC, and despite the differences (the bronze statue may have shown Demetrios wearing his helmet), the monument set up in the Athenian Agora was, like the prototypes of the Alexander sarcophagus and (translated into three dimensions) the Alexander mosaic, undoubtedly an influence on this votive relief (Houser, 1982, pp. 229-238). The bronze statue in Athens has been restored wearing a crested helmet with a Pegasus support under the crest on top. Since no other early equestrian representation of this type show the ruler, Alexander the Great or a successor, wearing such a helmet, it is tempting to think the helmet was part of a trophy on the plinth or was set on the plinth, perhaps under the horse's hoof.

These figures have been known from Neo-Classic times onward as Narcissus, from the pose that appears on Graeco-Roman gems and pastes.  Dorothea Arnold has dated this particular excellent and very Greek copy in the Hadrianic period (Arnold, 1969, p. 255, no. 16).  The original statue, doubtless in bronze, could have been a very late work of Polykleitos, in the 430s BC, or a creation by a follower, or a statue by a sculptor of the first century BC who revived the master's style.     There are also those who point to the fact that one of the copies has wings in the hair, indicating identification as Hermes or Hypnos.  Because an idol of Aphrodite is occasionally part of the support and because copies, as well as representations on gems, show the attributes of a hunter, including the boar's head, Adonis has been suggested as the subject (Blanco, 1957, p. 84, under no. 124-E, pl. LXXXIV).   A Graeco-Roman marble copy with an ancient and belonging boar's head as part of the tree-trunk support (on top, below the youth's elbow) has long stood in the Italian Renaissance gardens of Isabella Stewart Gardner's country estate at Green Hill in Brookline, Massachusetts. In November 1986, the current owner of this portion of the gardens, Mr. William Binnie, presented this statue and other former Gardner marbles from around the property to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum at Fenway Court in Boston.  This statue certainly came from Italy in the nineteenth century and was probably restored by Bartolommeo Cavaceppi in the eighteenth century.  It confirms that other copies of the Polykleitan boy victor (""Narcissus"") where the antiquity of the boar's head has been questioned, as the copy at Holkham Hall in Norfolk, England (Arnold, 1969, p. 258, no. 35; Waywell, 1978, p. 8, no. 20; Vermeule, C., von Bothmer, D., 1959, pp. 153-154), were clearly based on ancient sculptural models, as well as on Graeco-Roman gems.  Many have called these versions of the youth Meleager, but (aside from the connections with Aphrodite mentioned above) the slender figure seems better suited to Adonis, especially when the statue is compared with the copies of the Meleager of Skopas.

The nose, upper lip, and left ear are restored in Luna marble. The hair at the head's own right side has been reworked. The ""brown coating,"" mentioned by Michaelis (Michaelis, 1882, pp. 484-485, no. 19) has been removed.   The subject may be Hera or Ceres, a draped Aphrodite, or a personified divinity (e.g., Concordia). The remains of ancient drillwork, channels and points, in the hair on the head's right side and around the outer part of the right ear suggest that it was carved in the Antonine or even the Severan periods of the Roman Empire. It is difficult to say whether the statue showed a seated or standing goddess personification with her cloak over the top and back of her head, but the turn of the head on the neck might suggest a statue standing in a pose of some torsion, the way large-scale, draped females in the Pergamene tradition were often represented.  A head, presumably from a standing statue, found in the Temple of Apollo at Cyrene, although turned to the subject's left rather than right, is a good indicator of how this type of cult or votive creation was circulated in the last years of the Roman Republic and the early Empire (Huskinson, 1975, pp. 67-68, no. 126, pl. 49). The much freer, early Hellenistic style of this cult image's forerunner is anticipated in a female head in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (Richter, 1954, p. 91, no. 168, pl. CXX).    A head of a goddess wearing a jeweled diadem and a himation in the form of a veil over the back of her head poses the possibility that some of these heads can represent very idealized empresses, such as Hadrian's wife Sabina (died A.D. 135), although the Harvard head does not seem to have any qualities of imperial portraiture (Vermeule, C., Neuerburg, 1973, pp. 19-20, no. 37).

The left leg is preserved almost to the left foot, and it shows the weight was on the right leg. The object held in the left hand, in front of the folds of the cloak, may be a bird, in which case this could be a small statue of Asklepios or a person making an offering to the god of medicine. Perhaps this is a statue of Hippocrates.   The bird ought to be a cock or rooster, since pet birds are generally held by children in Attic funerary sculpture (as in the stele of Melisto, about 340 B.C., no. 24, above), but the surfaces are too worn to say with confidence here. When Asklepios himself is accompanied by a cock, the bird is usually being offered to him by an attendant (or Gallus, making a sacrifice), as in the Juturna precinct near the Temple of Castor and Pollux in the Roman Forum (Boni, 1901, pp. 114-117, fig. 75). These representations are usually connected with statues in which Asklepios holds a rotulus or scroll in one hand, which could conceivably be the case here if the god rather than Hippocrates or a votary were represented.

The nude figure is seated, with legs a little apart, upon some drapery spread over a pyramidal-shaped rock, set on a rough, circular base.  Part of her left hand touching the drapery beside her is visible. The draper flows down in wide folds and stops just beneath her feet. She is seated slightly to the right of the seat.    The figure is patently fat and unideal.  The subject may be Lamia seated in the country; known from Aristophanes and various Greek vases, this very rotund, sometimes sphinx-like creature would be a very suitable subject for the decorative naturalism of Hellenistic sculpture (Vermeule, E., 1977, pp. 296-297).

The Eros touches the figure's left knee with the right hand and the Sphinx's right paw with the left hand.   D. G.

The statuette is cut off at the knees; only the lower legs and feet remain on a circular plinth. The surfaces are chipped and abraded.  From the heaviness of the drapery behind and its elegance in front, this could be a version of the fifth century B.C. standing Aphrodite wrongly called the Venus Genetrix from her appearance and so labeled on Roman coins. The feet are bare, suggesting a goddess, and the folds of drapery falling vertically in front could suggest Isiac dress above. The cloak is not fringed, however, and an Alexadrine Venus Genetrix slightly influenced by Isiac types seems a better identification.   Just such a complete statuette in marble, minus the attribute in the left hand (which, if a jug, could make the figure a fountain nymph), was in the London art market a decade ago (Sotheby Sale, 10 July, 1972, London, no. 186, pl. XLIX). Another, slightly more refined but missing the lower limbs, feet, and plinth, was also in London (Sotheby Sale, 4 May, 1970, London, p. 60, no. 166, plate opposite). Sometimes the drapery around the lower limbs of these small statues is very transparent, leaving the heavy bunch only where it falls down between the legs and spreads out onto the plinth. Such is the case with the diademed Aphrodite with Eros on the plinth at her left side found near Manavgat and with the sculptures in the museum at Side. It appears to have been carved with portrait features, as late as the year A.D. 300 (Inan, 1975, pp. 41-43, no. 8, pl. XX).   The very elegant drapery of the Aphrodite of the Fréjus type (a copy of about A.D. 100) in the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence (no. 23.351), show how the drapery of this fragment was reduced and greatly simplified from the general prototype created in Athens around 420 B.C. and its many late Hellenistic and Roman imperial adaptations (Ridgway, 1972, pp. 40-42, no. 14, illus. pp. 159-160, fig. 3, p. 161).

A lekythos with reversed scene, dated 375-350 BC is in the collection of Mr. Gilbert Denman, Jr., in San Antonio (Hoffmann, 1970, pp. 24-25, no. 7).

Both arms from below the shoulders, and the legs diagonally across the upper thighs, are missing, as are much of the genitals. ""Puntelli"" remain on both sides near the line of the hips, also at the left shoulder.  The pose and the positions of the three puntelli, as well as the characteristic lines of the shoulder blades and the lower part of the back above the buttocks, all suggest that this small statue was a reduced version of one of the variations on the original Meleager by Skopas. The left arm was lowered and the spear seems to have run beside the shoulder (hence the puntello on the upper arm) rather than against the shoulder (as in the Berlin and Copenhagen versions) or under the armpit (as in the famous Harvard statue).  Positions of the right arm behind the lower back vary, and here the arm may have been attached to the support at the right side, although a rough spot suggests a small strut extending from the middle of the right buttock.    Like the Berlin and Harvard versions, this putative Meleager wore no cloak around the shoulders and left arm. The dog may have been beside the tree trunk on the right side, like the Copenhagen copy, and there is no way of telling whether there was another stump surmounted by the boar's head, as in the restoration of the Vatican statue, or even whether the stump at the right was plain, and the hound was at the hero's left.  The Vatican copy suggests that only the variations with the cloak flying out at the left side would need a second heavy support, although something was often needed to protect and prop up the spear. This would be especially true when the spear was beside rather than against or under the shoulder.  The Romans loved reduced scale statues of gods and heroes; they could be placed in the gardens of houses or even on tables and in niches within. The Meleager type, whether used for this or another heroic hunter, was popular in palaces, baths, and villas from Italy to Cyprus. Variant versions in marble also featured different attributes and positions. The original bronze statue of the fourth century BC did not need the explanatory props found in the marbles--e.g., a routine decorative statue such as this torso or a masterpiece like the Forbes-Webster Meleager [1926.48].

The torso was turned a little to its left. The right arm was raised, and the left arm was lowered. What remains shows a body that was well proportioned, almost muscular.   The complete statue showed the figure leaning against a support below the left arm, with the end of the cloak around the lower limbs brought over this wrist and then hanging down in zigzag folds. A lifesize version of this figure was found at Pergamon, and a small statue, like this fragment, was published in the possession of Mr. Piero Tozzi, New York (Bieber, 1961, pp. 124-125, fig. 492).

In the Harvard torso, it is a step not at all far to the two-figure groups of Pan or a satyr advancing on a seated hermaphrodite with lust in his heart and on his mind. Indeed, in pose and style this torso is very like the corresponding section of the group from the Western Baths at Cherchel, carved Italy of Luna marble (Gauckler, 1895, pp. 123-124, pl.

Such small heads of Eros also come from figures that were the supports for larger statues, as the Eros on a dolphin next to the left thigh of a Roman Imperial Aphrodite in Boston (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 120, no. 183), and the Eros striding forward beside the dolphin in a fragment from a similar statue, where only the lower half of the dolphin and the section of the supporting plinth are preserved (Christie's Sale, London, 13-14 December, 1983, p. 56, no. 339, color illus. and color plate on cover).

The Demeter of the Vatican offers an indication of the type of colossal Roman copy that suggests the source for a small Hellenistic head of the type at the Harvard University Art Museums (Winter, 1900, pl. 282, no. 8).   Small statues or large statuettes in the best Greek traditions of 440-340 B.C. and representing Demeter or Persephone in the full, heavy garments of major cult images were popular in Attica, and, especially, the Greek islands. The Demeter or Persephone von Matsch, once in Vienna and now in the Indianapolis Museum of Art, represents the latest end of the spectrum (Vermeule, C., 1981, p. 86, no. 56). At the beginning of the fourth century B.C. we have the Demeter in the Museo Archeologico, Venice, which has the mantle drawn up over the head and a heavy peplos below (Fuchs, 1969, pp. 212-213, fig. 228). It seems safe to say that when these small statues in the sartorial taste of Kephisodotos's Eirene with Plutos are veiled, they represent the elder agricultural goddess.

Many ancient bronze statuettes were actually composed of several pieces that were cast separately and then assembled by soldering. This arm was made separately to be soldered onto a statuette that would have been cast without a left arm. D. K. Hill identified dozens of left arms and statuettes without left arms where the statuettes had clearly been created that way (1). Left arms were more likely to have been lost, because, as the less active arm, they were frequently covered in drapery or held heavy attributes. It was therefore sensible to mass-produce, so to speak, left arms for attachment to statuettes as needed (2). The drapery would have helped to conceal the join of the arm to the body. An arm of this type would have been most appropriate for a statuette of the Dioskouroi or Mercury (Hermes). According to Hill, most of these types of statuettes are Early or Middle Imperial, while the type of cloak and drapery appears on Hellenistic marble statues (3).   NOTES:   1. See D. K.

300001,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This nude male figure stands on a circular base. His knees are bent, and his left leg is advanced slightly ahead of the right. His short, flipper-like arms are extended horizontally from his shoulders and bent forward slightly. The right arm still holds the end of a separately cast metal rod inserted through a perforation. The left arm, while perforated in the same way, retains nothing in its perforation. The right arm projects farther forward than the left. The figure’s torso is minimally modeled, with indications of a diaphragm, from which a ridge extends downward to the genitalia. A vertical groove running from the shoulders to the middle of the back indicates the spinal column. The buttocks are small rounded protrusions, separated by a deep groove. The shinbones are sharp ridges that extend to the tops of the ankles. The feet end in points, suggesting that the figure may have been represented as wearing shoes. A short penis projects downward and is set off by marked grooves along the groin to either side. The large head has prominent, detailed features, including narrow oval eyes that slant downward at the outer corners, and under-brow ridges that display fine parallel incisions. A pointed chin, marked by fine vertical incisions, widens out to grooves in front of the ears. The ears project as rounded rectangular tabs, which are perforated. Both perforations contain circular earrings (1). A blade-like projection extends from the back of the head and hangs down to the base of the neck.    The modeling of the body and of the arms, as well as the large and unusually detailed head, finds its closest analogies in human bronze statuettes from Thessaly from the last quarter of the eighth century through the first half of the seventh century BCE (2). While the figure is clearly modeled in the northern Geometric fashion, the large head with its detailed facial features places it toward the end of that tradition. Therefore, a date between 700 and 670 BCE seems likely. The circular base is unusual; its presence suggests that the figure may have been mounted on top of a larger object, such as the lid of a cauldron.   NOTES:   1.

300052,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This large, beautiful lamp was designed so that it could hang from six suspension hooks, one on each nozzle, or be set in a stand, stabilized by the knob on the underside. However, the elaborate relief decoration on the underside indicates that it was clearly intended to be viewed from below when in use. The lamp has six nozzles designed in two alternating styles. The three larger nozzles are in the form of volutes with a rosette at each termination and, on the underside, the head of a deity emerging from a corolla composed of seven long, evenly spaced loops in low relief. The three smaller nozzles are in the form of ships' prows. The rounded, bowl-shaped reservoir is encircled with a vine, applied after the wax model for the body was cast. The discus is flat and is set off by a rounded molding. The large central fill hole is surrounded by a rim and two concentric grooves. A few very small holes were provided to release air as the lamp burned.   The volute nozzles are short and have triangular ends (1). On the flat top of each nozzle is a suspension loop in the form of the curved neck and head of a water bird, the beak bent flat on the surface; within each loop is a single wire hoop, probably the remains of the suspension system. The feathers are indicated by scalloped incisions. On the underside of these nozzles is the head of a deity whose straight hair falls from a topknot in waves on either side of the face, one lock looped over each ear. A fringe of hair, or perhaps a lotus leaf, is in the center of each forehead, and parted, grass-like strands under the chin join the heads to the corolla. The youthful faces have slightly parted full lips, and there is an impressionistic rendering of their features that imparts a lively, breathing feeling. Although this might indicate that these are images of the winds, the association with the ships and the grass-like strands of hair suggest that they are deities connected with the water (2).   The alternating three nozzles are about half the size of the head nozzles. They are plain on the underside and sharply pointed (3). On the top, they are formed to represent ships’ prows with projecting cutwaters, a type that occurs on a wide range of Roman nautical vessels (4). On each is a scroll-shaped suspension hook, only one of which is completely preserved. Although lamps in the form of ships are common, the Harvard lamp has no known parallel (5).    NOTES:   1.

301881,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This small, seated figure holds a long, stringed musical instrument in front. The period in which it was made is unclear. The face is simply rendered with a bulbous nose and circular eyes. The figure’s mouth may be rendered open, perhaps to indicate singing. The edge of the base has been reduced with a modern rotary grinding tool.   Simply formed figures of this type are often labeled Coptic. The Harvard musician may have belonged to a larger composition, as indicated by a small copper alloy model temple on top of which are seated five musicians that are very similar to the Harvard piece, and at least one also plays a stringed instrument (1). Other similar unassociated Coptic musicians were known previously in Berlin (2). The Harvard piece is similar in scale and modeling to a small statuette purchased in Egypt of a woman holding a mirror (3) and to Coptic statuettes in Cairo (4). A similar seating arrangement and oversized hands are also seen in a piece in the Benaki Museum, Athens (5).   NOTES:   1.

The delicate, almond-shaped eye with its extended cosmetic line and the pierced earlobe may date this piece in the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1076-725 BCE), although it could be slightly later (1).

302056,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This slender stallion walks forward with his right legs advanced and his left legs drawn back. His slender proportions suggest a young horse. His head and mane are partially obscured by areas of corrosion and incrustation. However, where the incrustation has broken away, one can see that the mane consists of separated relief locks with extremely fine incision defining the individual groups of hairs. The tail, which extends downward to the level of the hooves, has vertical incisions along its entire length with a double incision running down the back. The spaces between these lines are thickly filled with tiny, closely spaced diagonal incisions. There are traces of shallower incisions marking the muscles on the left rear haunch. There are no indications that there was a rider.    Despite the damage to its surface, this small horse is a spirited rendition of a young stallion. With his long tail stretching down to the hooves, the horse appears to be a direct descendent of the many eighth-century BCE Geometric bronze horses with similar tails that stand on solid or openwork bases. The elongated body and vertically arranged relief locks point to a date somewhere in the second quarter of the sixth century BCE. In particular, the mane calls to mind the arrangements of locks on the heads of horses on the Athenian black-figure “horse-head amphorae” of c. 600-570 BCE (1), as well as those on the mane of the idiosyncratic Archaic equestrian bronze group from Grumentum, southern Italy, now in the British Museum (2). The delicacy of pose, proportions, and incised decoration make an attribution to a bronze-casting center on mainland Greece, perhaps Corinth, attractive. However, the function of this statuette remains unclear. While it could have decorated the rim of a tripod or krater, it may equally well have been intended as a freestanding offering at a sanctuary (3).   NOTES:   1. See A.

303389,Published Catalogue Text,1990,"Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums","138  Statue of the Emperor Trajan  The right shoulder and section of the chest, also the remaining section of the upper arm, have been broken and rejoined. The head and neck were made separately and inset. The statue was taken apart completely, cleaned, redoweled, and reconstituted at the Fogg Museum during 1983-1985.   Marcus Ulpius Traianus, of Roman Spanish ancestry and son of a distinguished Roman magistrate, was adopted by the aged Senator Nerva (emperor, A.D. 96-98) and ruled as emperor from A.D. 98-117. It was in this time, with the conquest of Dacia and military expeditions on the eastern frontier from Armenia to Arabia, that the Roman Empire reached its maximum geographical area. This statue shows Trajan in ceremonial armor (in contrast to the field equipment seen on the Column of Trajan in Rome), standing or stepping forward as if in the act of addressing his troops. His elaborate cuirass or breastplate has long tabs or pteryges, leather straps at the shoulders, and longer leather straps around the thighs. A tunic is visible under this ensemble, and a long cloak or paludamentum is worn on the left shoulder and around the left arm. The open-toed sandals are purely ceremonial, in keeping with the symbolic nature of the statue as suggested here and in previous publications.   In recent years, studies of important Roman Imperial cuirassed statues have been concerned with the meaning of scenes and objects on the ceremonial armor of these images. This statue of Trajan, presumably brought to England from Italy in the eighteenth century, is no exception. Here the decorative enrichment of the cuirass and of the tabs below appears to allude to the emperor's untimely death from natural causes at Selinus (Trajanopolis) in Cilicia at a time when the wars on the Parthian frontier were going badly for the Roman armies. This was also the period when the Jewish communities of North Africa, Mesopotamia, and Cyprus were developing a major revolt, which devastated cities such as Cyrene and parts of Alexandria in Egypt (Lepper, 1948, pp. 89-92; Magie, 1950, pp. 609-613). After Trajan's widow Plotina had engineered Hadrian's alleged adoption and his recognition as emperor (ruled A.D. 117-138), and after the Roman East was pacified and the frontiers stabilized, Rome and the surrounding towns were awash with monuments to the deified Trajan, the greatest of these being the Trajaneum at the end of the Forum Traiani. The provinces were similarly embellished—witness the Trajaneum at Pergamon. While this statue is not heroic, semi-nude, Jovian image of a true Divus, in the traditions of the Primaporta Augustus, it has enough of the subtle allusions of cuirassed iconography to show this was a statue of Trajan in his period of transition from emperor to god.   The main scene on the breastplate is an Amazon or female Arimaspe fighting two griffins, all symbolic of wars on the eastern frontiers of the Roman Empire. On the tabs of the skirt below, at the bottom of the breastplate and above the leather straps, bovine skulls alternate with palmettes. The skull, rather than the bull's or cow's head, very often suggests death and funerary commemoration. Combined here with a portrait of Trajan based on a model created fairly late in his reign, this iconography suggests the statue was a posthumous commemoration of the Optimus Princeps, the ""best of princes"", as Trajan was hailed by the Roman Senate. The statue was carved in the months or years immediately after the emperor's death, when monuments such as the Arch of Trajan at Beneventum were completed to honor the military and civic acts of the ruler who brought the Roman Empire to its greatest heights. That the cuirassed statue is one of a vigorous commander addressing his troops, rather than an ill, old man, is emphasized in the pose and proportions of the body, based on the ideal statue of Achilles by Polykleitos, a bronze known as the Doryphoros or Spear-Bearer.

303568,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The plaque, executed in repoussé, depicts three male busts encircled by medallions. Each figure is nimbed and holds a book in his left hand. Inscriptions in Greek, from left to right around the heads, identify the figures as St. Paul, St. Peter, and St. Andrew. The saints are depicted following traditional Byzantine iconographic conventions: Paul is an older man with thinning hair and a pointed beard; Peter wears curly bangs and a short beard; Andrew, the youngest of the three, has thick hair and a pointed beard. Paul and Peter make a gesture of blessing with their right hands; Andrew holds a long cross.    Solder on the back of the plaque indicates that it was originally attached to another metal surface. It is possible that the relief decorated a reliquary. No middle Byzantine examples of bronze reliquaries survive (1). However, middle Byzantine silver-gilt reliquaries commonly feature medallion portraits of saints, executed in repoussé, enamel, or a combination of both (2). The same three apostles—with the addition of St. James between Peter and Andrew—are carved on the side of a tenth-century Byzantine ivory reliquary box (3). Peter, Paul, and Andrew are also represented side by side on two Byzantine ivory triptychs dated to the tenth- to eleventh-centuries (4). A middle Byzantine date for this plaque is supported by these comparisons in other media, as well as the presence of Andrew, who only rarely appears in early Byzantine art, but is depicted more frequently on tenth- to eleventh- century ivories (5). Patterns of wear on the faces of the saints may indicate ritual touching of the sacred figures; alternatively, this deterioration—isolated to the areas of highest relief—may be the result of wear from handling of the object that the plaque originally decorated.

303605,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The figure of a striding bull with a sun disc and uraeus between its horns refers to the cult of the bull in its association with the sun god, and by extension, kingship. The wild bull, as the embodiment of aggression and sexual potency, was incorporated into royal imagery. Although there were several bull cults throughout Egypt, the best known is that of the Apis bull of Memphis, the location of the ancient capital. From at least the First Dynasty onward, the Apis bull was associated with the king, and a yearly procession of the sacred animal celebrated its cult (1). It is known from inscriptions as the incarnation of the god Ptah and, after its death, was associated with Osiris. In later periods, particularly as the pharaonic tradition waned, the Apis bull procession grew in popularity among the common people. Only one bull at a time was identified as the sacred Apis bull, probably determined by special markings. It was kept in its own sanctuary near the temple of Ptah, and when it died, it was buried with lavish ceremony in the necropolis at Saqqara, just outside Memphis. Cambyses, the Persian king who conquered Egypt in 525 BCE, allegedly committed one of the gravest sins when he killed the Apis bull, as recorded by Herodotus (3.27-29). The Ptolemaic rulers, however, continued the tradition of maintaining the sacred bull, and its cult remained active into the Roman period.   The Late Period bronzes are highly standardized, producing the angular form of a striding bull. Herodotus writes that one of the markings found on the sacred Apis bull of Memphis was the likeness of an eagle on its back (3.28). This report finds a parallel in the markings seen on many of the bronze bull statuettes produced in the first millennium BCE, often executed in a secondary metal inlay. All such bull figurines display outstretched wings across their shoulders and haunches, although the marking can vary in terms of details, including winged discs, scarabs, and vultures. In between the two outstretched wings, across the backs, rests a rectangular saddle blanket. These markings appear on three of the Harvard pieces, clearly on 1919.525 and more faintly on 1967.11 (2). Some attempts have been made to classify the Apis bull figurines based on the covariance of the different elements, but the typology remains insecure (3).   The proper left ear and solar disc are missing from this bull (4).   NOTES:   1. See A. Dodson, “Bull Cults,” in Divine Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt, ed. S.

303606,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"During the first millennium BCE and especially in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, the cult of Isis extended throughout the Mediterranean. This simple but elegant figure group displays the most popular representation of the seated goddess holding the reclining infant Horus (Harpokrates) to her breast. The figures of Isis and Harpokrates were probably cast solid separately and then joined together. The nude figure of Harpokrates follows a standard form and includes a side-lock of youth; both arms rest at his sides.    Isis had over time absorbed characteristics of other goddesses. An example here is her headdress, comprising a sun disc set between flaring cow horns (broken on the proper left side), which is typically associated with the goddess Hathor. The uraeus ornamenting the front of her wig signals Isis’ close ties to royalty. In myth, this is affirmed through Isis’ relationship as sister and wife of Osiris, with whom the deceased pharaoh was identified, and as mother of Horus, the divine counterpart of the living pharaoh. Her tight, ankle-length sheath and tripartite wig harken back to traditional pharaonic iconography, as does the positioning of Harpokrates at a right angle to her, which is comparable to an Old Kingdom statue of the Sixth Dynasty pharaoh Pepi II (c. 2300-2206 BCE) seated on his mother’s lap  (1). Holding her right hand to her left breast, Isis epitomizes maternal love (2). As her popularity increased during the Late Period onward, Isis acquired universal traits as a mother goddess, and her cult continued perhaps as late as the sixth century CE, when the temple of Isis at Philae was closed by the emperor Justinian (3). The representation of her suckling the infant Horus seen in this statuette may have served as the source for Christian iconography of the Virgin Mary nursing the infant Jesus.    NOTES:   1.

303607,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Harpokrates, shown in striding position and wearing the Double Crown, stands toward the back of a large rectangular base (1). Faint traces of an inscription exist on the front of the base. The trailing tail of the uraeus continues onto the tall White Crown. The attached side-lock has a dark brown patina that differs from the rest of the figure, which is covered with thin, compact layers of green colored corrosion products. Fine modeling is apparent despite the poor condition of the metal. The proper right arm, now missing, would have been held up to the mouth. The lowered left hand with a hole in it may have held an attribute such as a staff. The proper left leg below the knee is also lost; a rectangular aperture in the base indicates its former position. A second aperture on the base served an unknown function. The roundness and fullness of the face suggest a late date in the third or second century BCE (2). In addition, the modeling of the buttocks and legs exhibits torsion of naturalistic movement associated with the Graeco-Roman periods.             Harpokrates represents the god Horus as a child, shown nude with the side-lock of youth on the right side of his head and his right index finger to his mouth. As the son of Osiris and Isis, he gained immense popularity during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, during which time the production of bronze figurines of Harpokrates flourished. He often wears the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, a feature common in first millennium Egypt when youthful deities acquired kingly attributes. Another characteristic headdress is the nemes head cloth, although frequently the boy is depicted with either a shaven head or a tight-fitting skull cap. His nude body typically retains the roundness of flesh associated with young boys. The child-god could be represented seated, striding, or squatting. When seated, he assumes a semi-reclining position derived from that of a baby on its mother’s lap; many of the smaller examples of these figurines may originally have belonged with a seated Isis figure (3). Suspension loops for attachment as a pendant indicate an amuletic connection that may have been particularly associated with young children.    NOTES:   1.

303643,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The handle of this fragmentary mirror terminates in the head of an animal, possibly a deer. On the obverse, the disc is decorated with a notched border, and the extension carries a flame design. On the reverse, the medallion shows two young men (possibly the Dioskouroi) facing one another and dressed in short tunics and Phrygian caps. A star or rosette is suspended in the field between them (1).   There are ten Etruscan bronze mirrors in the collection of the Harvard Art Museums, ranging in date from the early fifth century to the mid second century BCE. All the mirrors bear engraved designs, and the more elaborately decorated medallions contain scenes involving human or divine figures. Identifiable subjects include a seated Hermes and Lasa (1932.56.38), as well as two young men wearing short chitons and Phrygian caps (1932.56.37); the latter pair may be the Dioskouroi (2). The subjects depicted on other mirrors are more difficult to identify with certainty. One such example is a scene depicting two young men flanking two women, one of whom is nude, in front of an architectural structure (1977.216.1995.A-B); it has been suggested that the figures may be Helen, Clytemnestra, and the Dioskouroi (3). Another scene, less well preserved, shows a figure wearing a peplos and helmet flanked on the left by a man in a short tunic and boots, and on the right by an unidentified woman wearing a peplos and Phrygian cap (1977.216.2311). The central figure is most likely Athena (Etruscan Menrva), and while the figure on the left leans on a club similar to the one often carried by Herakles, it is unusual for that hero to be shown clothed (4). The three stand before a two-story Ionic structure.   Two mirrors in the collection show signs of an interesting afterlife. The disc of 1977.216.2311 has been perforated in ten places, probably as a means of ensuring that the object would be useless to the living and could be permanently dedicated to the deceased; a less plausible suggestion is that the mirror was reused as a strainer (5). Another mirror in the collection (1977.216.3422), if it is ancient, seems to have been reworked in modern times by an engraver who added to the medallion a female bust, a recumbent male, and an inscription. Neither the style nor the subject of the engraving corresponds to examples known from other Etruscan mirrors, and both the engraving and the inscription appear to have been made with a modern instrument (6).

The two discs are similar enough to have been made using the same mold. On each disc, the lion’s face is rendered in high relief. The mane completely surrounds the face in straight, thin locks. The lion’s brows are raised and furrowed with an impressed line running along each one. The round eyes on each disc, with upper and lower lids rendered, have white and orange discolorations, but it is not clear whether these are intentional or the result of corrosion. The nose and cheekbones are rendered naturalistically. The mouth is open in a snarl, and the upper and lower sections are connected by two thin strips representing overlapping canine teeth (broken on one side on 2004.202.B). The upper teeth are rendered as a strip between the canines (preserved on 2004.202.A only), with the incisors separated by impressed lines; the lolling tongue covers the lower teeth and much of the lower lip and chin. A molded rim consisting of two raised bands encircles the mane, and the traces of iron corrosion on three equally spaced locations in the border of each disc show where clamps would have affixed the plate to a piece of furniture or something similar. A thin ring likely ran through the open mouth, held in place by the vertical teeth.   This type of lion-headed handle would have been attached to a wooden sarcophagus or chest, and many examples have been found in Roman Syria (1). It could have been used as a handle for grasping and carrying or merely as a decorative element. The motif of the lion-headed handle also appears on marble sarcophagi (2).   NOTES:   1.

It shows a bearded giant to the left, his scaly snake legs coiling below, with the snakehead of his right leg looking up, his muscular body frontal, and his arms raised above his head, preparing to hurl a boulder at Athena to his right. The light folds of Athena's drapery follow the curves of her legs; her chiton is cinched at the waist, and her aegis is clearly visible at her breast. Athena raises her right arm, and the remains of her tresses fall on her right shoulder. Her head and left arm and shoulder are lost. There is a rosette in the lower left corner pierced for attachment. The background is filled with small dots, and two small flowers are incised to the right of the giant.   The plate bears an extremely fine depiction of a section of the Gigantomachy (battle between gods and giants), which was a frequent motif in Greek art, particularly on large-scale sculptural works like temples and most notably on the Great Altar at Pergamon (2).

The helmet is green and light brown, almost completely mineralized, with a great deal of corrosion visible on the exterior. Two sections are missing from the brim.   The helmet is probably a representative of the Vetulonian sub-type of Negau helmets (1). Vetulonian helmets are one of the most common varieties of the type; they seem to have been manufactured in Etruscan and central Italy in the 5th century BCE. The helmets may have also had attachments for horsehair crests, but these attachments do not often survive.   NOTES:   1. For a discussion of the evolution, decoration, and distribution of Italian helmets, including the Negau variant, see M. Egg, “Italische Helme mit Krempe,” in Antike Helme: Sammlung Lipperheide und andere Bestände des Antikenmuseums Berlin, Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Forschungsinstitut für Vor- und Frühgeschichte Monographien 14 (Mainz, 1988) 222-70, esp. 243-70.

57664,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This incense shovel consists of a shallow rectangular pan and a half-cylinder handle (1). The pan is decorated with a molded rim on three sides with incised grooves and acroterion-like projections on the two corners adjacent to the handle. The pan rests on four small feet, one near each corner of the pan, and there may have originally been a fifth to support the handle.   The handle takes the shape of an unfluted column with a Corinthian capital; the capital has three visible leaves and a thin abacus. A rounded torus (ring) marks the center of the column. At the terminal of the handle, a flat metal tang sticks up from the column base. The handle is hollow on the underside, with a strengthening bar running the length of the column. It is attached to the pan by means of two projecting tangs joined to the underside of the rim.   Incense shovels such as this one are often found in multiples, particularly in Israel and Syria, and they may have played a role in Jewish religious practices (2).   NOTES:   1.

The plaque is rectangular, with a canvas delineated by a line that may be related to a now-lost wooden frame rather than a purposeful incision. The incised inscription is in four lines. There are four small V-shaped notches in the upper left corner. The strokes of letters are not as deep in the upper left as on the rest of the canvas, although the serifs are as deep.   The Flavia Valeria Eutropia mentioned is likely the half-sister of the Emperor Constantine I. She and her son Nepotianus were put to death in 350 CE by the usurper Magnentius (r. 350-353 CE) after Nepotianus led a short-lived revolt against him (1).

The head of the lion is depicted frontally. The rope-like locks of the mane are rendered schematically in lines and relief around the head; other fur around the face is indicated by a series of dashed lines. The oval ears are rather flat, while the rest of the face is much more modeled, increasing in relief to the nose. The lion has a furrowed brow; the eyes have angular lines drawn around them, with the irises indicated by thin lines and the pupils indicated by a deeper circle. The nose is broad and partially obscured by accretions. The lion’s mouth is open, baring its teeth, and the tongue sticks out, resting on the lower lip. On either side of the jaw is an oblate hole through which the ring passes. The iron nails are in a triangular pattern, one under the chin and the other two flanking the ears. The ring is a thick metal bar with several raised, pinched lines; the metal does not form a complete circle, and there is a gap of c. 1 cm between the ends.   This type of lion-headed handle would have been attached to a wooden sarcophagus or chest, and many examples have been found in Roman Syria (1). It could have been used as a handle for grasping and carrying or merely a decorative element. The motif of the lion-headed handle also appears on marble sarcophagi (2).   NOTES:   1. T.

The horse heads are solid and very schematic, with pointed ears and a slight, raised crest to indicate the mane. Raised bumps represent eyes, but no other details are added. The attachment portion is a half cylinder, open on the back to fit onto the rim of a vessel. Three raised, vertical bands decorate the front of the cylinder, one under each horse head and one in the center. There is a single perforation through each end.    Very similar handle attachments are in the Badischen Landesmuseum Karlsruhe (1). Attachments of this type were fitted onto large bowls, and a wire handle for the bowl was affixed to the attachment plate at the holes under each horse’s head.   NOTES:   1. See F.

The horse has pointed curving ears, a slightly open mouth, and a thin curving neck. Raised sections on the upper portions of the fore- and hindquarters may indicate musculature. All four legs are separated, and hooves are modeled. The bending of the legs makes it appear as though the horse is depicted mid-gallop. Two points on top of the rectangular body indicate a saddle.    These cast-brass figurines in the shape of quadrupeds functioned as locks. Each was composed of two concave pieces joined together with a pin. A locking mechanism should be positioned in the interior of this intact, locked specimen. The bolts were cast separately from the bodies. To close the lock, the bolt was inserted through one end of the animal’s body and secured at the other (1). Locks of this design and style continued to be made in modern times (2). While the Harvard piece may be of medieval origin, it is equally possible that it was produced more recently.   NOTES:   1.

The woman wears a low, flat crown covered with a long veil that also covers her back and arms. Her hair is pulled back into several sections, parted in the front, with loose, wavy locks hanging down either side of her neck. Her eyes are unnaturally large; her upper and lower lids are rendered in relief, and her pupils are small incised dots. Her nose and mouth are small in her oval face. The neck is rather fleshy and rendered in two horizontal segments. Her garment, fastened at each shoulder by a circular fibula, is visible under her veil. The veil covers much of her right arm, but her forearm is visible, crossing her chest and grasping her left hand, which is emerging from the drapery of the veil. Her hands appear to be resting on a vertical baldric with an incised “X” and thin bands on the sides. The lions on each side stand with their back paws together, front paws on the shoulder of the woman, bodies in profile, and heads turned frontally, possibly with mouths open and tongues lolling. The lions have molded manes, with locks of wavy hair surrounding their round faces. Above the lion on the left is a six-point star; above the lion on the right is a crescent moon (1).   The round, relief-decorated discs in this group (2001.179.1 through 2001.192, along with 2002.281) may not all have had the same use, and it is difficult to know what the exact function of each object was (2). Medallions of this type could have been used as matrixes to create thin, metal, particularly gold and silver, repoussé appliques as elements of decoration and jewelry, or they could have been used as decorative elements themselves (3). Some could have been decorative elements of furniture fittings (4). Others could have decorated horse harnesses or provided the matrix to create decoration for horse harnesses (5). Other potential uses are as decorative elements or models for decorative elements worn by individuals as part of jewelry or belt decorations, as seen in sculptural depictions (6).

The face is well modeled, with arching brows, large eyes, a small nose, and a slightly pursed mouth set in his squarish face. His ears are large, with the details of the inner ears carefully rendered. His hair is uncovered, with slightly wavy locks rendered clearly around the forehead and the nape of the neck. The himation is largely featureless except for folds around the neck and bulges indicating the placement of his arms and legs. There is a roll of fabric around the neck with creases radiating down toward his right arm and shoulder. His arms appear to be folded and resting on his lap, and his knees are sharply bent. The hem of the himation ends at the youth’s ankles, leaving his feet exposed. The feet are not well enough preserved to determine whether he wore sandals or was barefoot. Viewed in profile, the youth appears to slouch forward, and his shoulders appear to be slumped or rolled forward. The underside of the statuette is hollow from the waist down. The back of the torso is modeled, but all modeling ends at the level of the seat.   This seated figure first appeared on the art market with a very similar seated statuette of an older male, also wrapped in a himation; H. Cahn suggested that they might have decorated the shoulder of a volute krater (1). Two comparable statuettes of seated men wearing mantles are known from Dodona (2). Other statuettes of seated men in himatia are known, although some are classified as Etruscan or South Italian (3).

145063,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This parabolic votive matrix bears a different incised scene on each side. On one side are two banqueters, one seated with one leg crossed over the other (1), facing to the right. The other figure, seated with both legs crossed, faces to the left. Both figures wear strips of cloth wrapped around their heads, the ends dangling behind them (2). Above each head is a crescent with an interior dot, perhaps marking them as deities or royalty (3). The figures seem to wear long sleeved shirts and baggy trousers. The figure on the left holds out a large cup in his right hand, while placing his left hand on his leg. The figure on the right holds a cup to his chest with his right hand, while his left hand is also placed on his leg. Two animals, possibly dogs, are at the bottom of the object, facing outward. The two banqueters are seated on a long rectangular shape with a checkerboard pattern interior. A decorative element hangs between the heads of the two figures, and the entire scene is surrounded by a beaded border.   On the other side, a man is shown riding an ibex to the left (4). The man perhaps wears a cuirass and baggy trousers, and like the figures on the front he also has a head wrap and crescent with a dot above his head. A floral object is in the field between the head of the man and the ibex. There is a quiver with arrows on his left hip, and he holds an upright spear in his left hand, while his right hand grasps the reins of the ibex. The ibex is equipped like a horse, with bridle, reins, and other decorations on its haunches. Its left forehoof is raised, while the other three hooves are on the groundline, which is filled with a lattice pattern. A beaded border surrounds this scene as well. The sides of the object are smooth and undecorated.   The round, relief-decorated discs in this group (2001.179.1 through 2001.192, along with 2002.281) may not all have had the same use, and it is difficult to know what the exact function of each object was (5). Medallions of this type could have been used as matrixes to create thin, metal, particularly gold and silver, repoussé appliques as elements of decoration and jewelry, or they could have been used as decorative elements themselves (6). Some could have been decorative elements of furniture fittings (7). Others could have decorated horse harnesses or provided the matrix to create decoration for horse harnesses (8). Other potential uses are as decorative elements or models for decorative elements worn by individuals as part of jewelry or belt decorations, as seen in sculptural depictions (9). Some might have been devotional or votive objects in their own right (10).   NOTES:   1.

146508,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This small, irregular disc is decorated with relief busts of Serapis and Isis. The reliefs are well worn, making the details difficult to discern. Bearded Serapis faces frontally and wears a modius (calathos) headdress. Isis, with her head turned slightly toward Serapis but her torso frontal, may be wearing her high crown and characteristic knot between her breasts. There is a small, thin vertical item in the field between the two figures, perhaps a sistrum (1). The back of the disc has lumpy, featureless corrosion.   Serapis and Isis were Egyptian deities who became popular throughout the Graeco-Roman world (2).

A circular hole in the center of the upraised left hand indicates that an object was previously attached there; a thumb is indicated, but no fingers. The right hand, which also has a perforation in the center, has no indication of fingers. The actor wears a mask with small, high-set, semicircular ears; exaggerated, arched brow ridges; large eyes and eyebrows; a small snub nose; and a long, full beard and moustache. Either the figure has short hair, indicated by short, shallow incisions, or the mask worn by the figure obscures those details. He wears a short, one-shouldered tunic; extending below the tunic and curving onto the right leg is a long fake phallus of the type worn by comic actors (1). Spiral lines decorate the legs and arms, possibly depicting more of a costume. The back is featureless except for indications of the tunic and lines on the back of the head.   A similar but more complete copper alloy figure of this type from Olynthus is dated to before the destruction of the city in 347 BCE (2). That figure has a more elaborate hat, slightly more detailed tunic, and the implements attached to his hands are still partially present (3).   NOTES:   1. See M.

147292,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The relief decoration on the disc of this medallion shows Serapis and a goddess, perhaps best identified as Tyche-Fortuna, standing side by side on a straight groundline. On the left, the bearded male figure appears to wear a modius on his head; he holds a patera or wreath in his lowered right hand and a cornucopia in his left arm (1). On the right, the female figure, possibly also wearing a modius, extends her right arm over a small altar, while also holding a cornucopia in her left arm. Both figures wear similar long garments and mantles that cover their left shoulders. The neckline and bust of the female figure, however, differ from the male figure, possibly representing an Isis knot. The facial features of both figures have been eroded by wear. The back is flat and featureless.    Although Serapis more often appears paired with Isis, a series of images shows him with a female figure who is not Isis, each holding a cornucopia and wearing similar garments as appear on the Harvard medallion (2). The figure may be identified as a city goddess based on the mural crown shown in some of the depictions (3).   The round, relief-decorated discs in this group (2001.179.1 through 2001.192, along with 2002.281) may not all have had the same use, and it is difficult to know what the exact function of each object was (4). Medallions of this type could have been used as matrixes to create thin, metal, particularly gold and silver, repoussé appliques as elements of decoration and jewelry, or they could have been used as decorative elements themselves (5). Some could have been decorative elements of furniture fittings (6). Others could have decorated horse harnesses or provided the matrix to create decoration for horse harnesses (7). Other potential uses are as decorative elements or models for decorative elements worn by individuals as part of jewelry or belt decorations, as seen in sculptural depictions (8).

Short curving locks representing the lion’s mane encircle the face. The raised brows are furrowed, with an impressed line running along each one. The eyes are circular, with modeled lids. The nose and cheekbones are rendered naturalistically. The mouth is open in a snarl, and the upper and lower sections are connected by two thin strips representing overlapping canine teeth. The upper teeth are rendered as a strip between the canines, and the lolling tongue covers the lower teeth and much of the lower lip and chin. Holes in the mane near the mouth and at the top would have affixed the plate to a piece of furniture or something similar. A thin ring likely ran through the open mouth, held in place by the vertical teeth.   This type of lion-headed handle would have been attached to a wooden sarcophagus or chest, and many examples have been found in Roman Syria (1). It could have been used as a handle for grasping and carrying or merely as a decorative element. The motif of the lion-headed handle also appears on marble sarcophagi (2).   NOTES:   1. T.

148167,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A double molding separates the lion mask from the hoop, which is roughly elliptical in section and flattened on the inside. Two curved grooves appear on the underside of the mask, in the portion that outlines the eyes.    The highly stylized lion mask appears to have been the invention of Luristan metal smiths. It is essentially a flattened top view of a feline’s head. Folds of skin surround the eyes like goggles; the nose and upper part of the muzzle are added on one end, and two rounded ears perk up on the other. Such masks appear as finials on bracelets and pins, such as 164.1972, and as junctures on pins with open-cast heads and halberd axes, such as 1943.1318 (1).   Lion-headed bracelets are well known from representations, and some originals survive from the early first millennium BCE. In most cases, the finials are full heads rather than masks, but masks occur on a pair of gold bracelets from a Neo-Assyrian royal burial at Nimrud dated to the second half of the eighth century BCE (2). Closest to the Luristan bracelets is the ornament worn by king Adda-Hamiti-Inshushinak of Elam on a relief fragment from Susa (3). A traditional symbol of power, the lion was often an attribute of the king. The popularity of lion masks on the Luristan bronzes suggests that larger sections of the population used this imagery, although it cannot be excluded that it was reserved for objects intended for dedication to a deity. The relief from Susa indicates that lion-mask bracelets were current in the Elamite realm in the mid-seventh century BCE.    The Harvard fragments are all of different sizes. The smallest head, 1969.177.35.2, also differs stylistically from the others, in that its multiple eyebrows form a continuous line with the nose, separating the face into two halves. This is the more common rendering. The other three finials are modeled very cursorily. The chemical composition suggests that fragments 1969.177.36.A, 1969.177.36.B, and 1969.177.36.C may indeed have come from the same bracelet, even though the seemingly ancient breaks do not match well and the two heads differ in size. Alternatively, they may be fragments from different bracelets, but may have been made from the same batch of metal. The similarity in style and workmanship of the heads leaves little doubt that these were made by the same craftsman (4).   NOTES:   1. Compare P. R. S.

164897,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The raised relief on this thick disc (6 mm) depicts a draped female bust. The woman’s torso is frontal, while her head is turned slightly upward and toward her right shoulder. Her hair is pulled into rolls framing her face; individual locks are faintly indicated and there may be a plain diadem depicted at the top of her head. The woman’s eyes are represented as small depressed points. Her nose has been worn away, and her mouth is worn down to a straight, incised line. Her long, oval face is set on a relatively wide neck, with horizontal folds of flesh indicated. The woman’s sleeveless garment is in place on her proper left shoulder, while it has fallen down, completely exposing her proper right shoulder (1). Raised folds in the drapery are concentrated especially around the proper left shoulder and the breasts. The bust ends just below both shoulders and the breasts. There are no other features on the front of this disc, and the back is flat and featureless.    The thickness of this medallion indicates that it might have been a decoration on an element of wagon equipment (2). The size, depiction, and thickness also resemble a medallion of Aphrodite at the Princeton University Art Museum (3). The relatively large undecorated area around the bust resembles examples said to have been found near Baalbek (4).   The round, relief-decorated discs in this group (2001.179.1 through 2001.192, along with 2002.281) may not all have had the same use, and it is difficult to know what the exact function of each object was (5).

Other potential uses are as decorative elements or models for decorative elements worn by people, as shown on tombstones (8). Some might have been devotional or votive objects in their own right (9). It has also been suggested that medallions of this type could have been used as matrixes to create thin, metal, particularly gold and silver, repoussé appliques as elements of decoration and jewelry, and this suggestion is not mutually exclusive with some of the above (10).

164898,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The raised relief decoration on this medallion depicts the frontal bust of a youthful deity, perhaps a solar deity such as Helios, Sol, or one of their Near Eastern equivalents. The deity has a prominent crown of sharp rays above his short, curly locks. He wears a sleeveless garment, which is secured at the shoulders with circular fibulae. The facial features are very cursorily rendered, with simple eyes, nose, and an almost sullen mouth. Below the lowest ray on each side and above each shoulder is a triangle with rays surrounding the uppermost point. It is difficult to pinpoint what the rayed triangles are meant to represent. They could be the tips of a crescent moon appearing behind the shoulders of the deity, such as the Palmyrene lunar deity Aglibol, who is depicted with a radiate crown or nimbus and a crescent moon behind his shoulders (1). The triangle shapes might also reference triangular votive reliefs that often feature depictions of a sun and moon deity along with the Near Eastern sky god known to the Romans as Juppiter Dolichensus (2). The triangles might also be symbols of the Dioskouroi, Castor and Pollux, in this case referencing their pointed caps, the fact that their heads are often surmounted by stars (here represented as incised rays), and that they are also iconographically associated with Helios (3). They might also represent mountains. Medallions depicting a radiate male deity appear in a variety of contexts in ancient Near Eastern art, notably on signa or semeia (standards) (4).   The round, relief-decorated discs in this group (2001.179.1 through 2001.192, along with 2002.281) may not all have had the same use, and it is difficult to know what the exact function of each object was (5).

A Roman standard bearer, a signifer or aquilifer, would typically have worn an animal skin as a hood and tied over his shoulders (2). On the other hand, this may be a Near Eastern representation, as eagles and standards (semeia) that were iconographically very similar to Roman military standards were also associated with deities in the Near East, notably in the cities of Hatra and Hierapolis (3).    The round, relief-decorated discs in this group (2001.179.1 through 2001.192, along with 2002.281) may not all have had the same use, and it is difficult to know what the exact function of each object was (4). Medallions of this type could have been used as matrixes to create thin, metal, particularly gold and silver, repoussé appliques as elements of decoration and jewelry, or they could have been used as decorative elements themselves (5). Some could have been decorative elements of furniture fittings (6). Others could have decorated horse harnesses or provided the matrix to create decoration for horse harnesses (7). Other potential uses are as decorative elements or models for decorative elements worn by individuals as part of jewelry or belt decorations, as seen in sculptural depictions (8). Some might have been devotional or votive objects in their own right (9).   NOTES:   1.

165002,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This thick disc is decorated with a relief showing three women standing on an uneven groundline. The central woman is nude and stands frontally, with her body in a slight S-curve, left leg forward, head turned slightly to her right, and both arms extended to rest on the shoulders of the women flanking her. The woman on the left has her back to the viewer, while the woman on the right stands in profile facing left. Both wear only bandeau bikini tops (1); they touch the central woman at her shoulders. All three women wear their hair pulled back; the flanking women may also be wearing diadems (a simple one on the left, and a more raised, stephane-type on the right). The back is flat and featureless.   While at first glance it might seem that the medallion depicts the three Graces, it is more likely that the two flanking women are attending the central woman, perhaps in the process of bathing (2).

The kneeling figure holds his arms in front of his torso and bent at the elbows; the left hand slightly higher than the right, and both palms are turned down. He may wear a headpiece, giving his head a bulbous profile in the back, or have a shaven head. Small eyes, nose, and mouth are visible—the ears are disproportionately large, with horizontal lines at the center. The lower legs are clearly shown drawn up under the upper legs. The bottoms of the feet are visible at the back, rendered with a space between them; below the feet and connecting them is a small tang for insertion into a base or mount.   The winged figure may represent Isis as a protective figure; her pose indicates that she would have been part of a group composition, with her arms held out to protect another figure in front of her. Her face is rather crudely modeled with a horizontal slit for the mouth and a flat nose. She wears the sun disc atop double circlets (the “modius crown”) with a vestigial uraeus on the upper circlet. Wings with ambiguous arm-like appendages along the top extend straight out in front, almost perpendicular to the body. Roughly incised feathers mark the outside surfaces; the inner surfaces remain unadorned and probably would have sheltered another figure, such as Osiris or the Apis bull (1). In later periods, Isis was considered the mother of the Apis bull, which after its death became associated with Osiris. Excavated examples of winged goddesses have been found at the Serapeum of Saqqara, the cult center for the Memphite Osiris-Apis (2). The proper left wing is broken at the join with the body. A pair of feet on a square base with peg below had been attached in modern times, but it may not belong to the figure. The metal is yellow, which may indicate that this piece is a modern creation.   Whether or not the kneeling figure and the winged figure belonged together in antiquity, this type of group, with a small adorant kneeling before a much larger deity, and each separately inserted into a single base, is known from several examples (3).

The edge of the front has short incised lines in a row around the flat border; the front and back are otherwise featureless. The front section retains a small part of the tang of the T-shaped section, which consists of a folded sheet of bronze and would have been used to attach the pendant to a string or chain so that it could be worn. The T-shaped section bears incised linear decoration at the middle and at one end, although it has not been preserved at the other end.   This bulla would have been worn by an Etruscan or Roman boy until adulthood (2).

Its legs taper to sharp points, and it displays the same angular file finishing as the female statuettes in the collection (1920.44.248 and 1992.256.90).    The facial features of this type of votive offering have a relatively uniform style: punched roundels for eyes, a raised ridge formed by the angular modeling of the head for a nose, and a simple incised groove for a mouth. Gender can be difficult to determine, as both male and female figures are depicted with nipples; the difference may be that “breasts” tend to be indicated by larger, punched roundels. Genitalia for the females are often an inverted triangle, while for the males there is a nearly circular knob of bronze, although sometimes it is flattened, making identification difficult. These statuettes also have a common stance with arms outstretched to the sides and legs parted in a V-shape. The open positioning of the arms is generally interpreted as a pose of prayer, consistent with that of other types of votive offerings found in tombs and sanctuary deposits (1). The Umbrian examples of this type of votive are cast and file finished; 1,600 of them were found in a pit deposit at a mountain sanctuary at the top of Monte Acuto, Italy (2).

If both wings had been present on both figures, the artist would not have been able to show the figures’ embrace (1).   The heads of the figures turn toward each other.  Although the features are soft, the general facial anatomy and hair are clear and in proportion; Psyche's cheeks are especially round. Cupid is nude with a child's body.

There is no indication of fingers; the molded thumb is disproportionately large, and there appears to be something held in the hand (perhaps part of the lion skin), which is a variant of this statue type. The right arm is raised, brandishing a club (now missing) behind his head. The anatomy of the figure is very schematic and stylized, lacking defined musculature. An incised cross on the torso indicates the pectorals. There is an incised line on the back, and the buttocks are modeled. The face is round; the eyelids are circles, the nose is very pointed, and the mouth is small. The head is uncovered; the hair is indicated by a series of ridges.   Statuettes showing Herakles in an attacking stance like this are very common in the ancient world (1). The god may have had a connection with cultivation in early Italy (2).   NOTES:   1. See A.-M.

183908,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The flat body of Osiris displays only a slight rise to indicate the buttocks and a faint indentation from the knees to the ankles to indicate the enshrouded legs. He wears the White Crown ornamented with a uraeus whose tail trails upward; possible protrusions on either side of the crown may have supported atef feathers. The face and crown are too heavily corroded to determine specific features. The hands are held side-by-side.   Osiris was one of the most popular gods of the Egyptian pantheon. Early in Egyptian history he represented a chthonic fertility god that later acquired the royal insignia of the crook and flail. He came to be identified as the ruler of the underworld. The Egyptian ruler, perceived during his lifetime as the incarnation of Horus, became Osiris after death. Over time, Osiris was equated with all deceased individuals and became a symbol of resurrection. The major cult shrine of Osiris was at Abydos in Middle Egypt, where Seti I (c. 1294-1279 BCE) built a magnificent temple in Dynasty 19.   Small bronze figurines representing Osiris show the god wrapped in a form-fitting garment, perhaps denoting a mummified shroud, and carrying the symbols of rulership—the crook and flail—in each hand. Enveloped in his shroud, Osiris’ arms are bound close to his body and his feet and legs stand together. The god is usually depicted wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt, ornamented with a uraeus (cobra) on the front and sometimes flanked by two feathers (the atef crown). In addition, this crown can rest on a set of spiraling ram’s horns that project to either side.    The bronze figurines take two basic forms: seated or standing. Within each group, several subgroups can be distinguished according to the placement of the hands. The hands can be side-by-side without overlapping, the proper right hand above the left in a vertical alignment, or crossed over one another at the wrists. G. Roeder associates the different poses to geographical areas within Egypt: those with hands side-by-side in Middle Egypt, those with hands one above the other in Lower Egypt, and those with the hands crossed over one another in Upper Egypt (1). The position of the hands also appears to correlate with other broad stylistic features. For example, the ridge created by the shroud pulled around the shoulders occurs primarily on figurines in which the hands are arranged one above the other.   NOTES:   1. G.

191740,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This fragment of a hoop belonging to a lion-mask bracelet is elliptical in section and slightly flattened on the inside. It is somewhat irregularly shaped, with a bump on the outer curve.    The highly stylized lion mask appears to have been the invention of Luristan metal smiths. It is essentially a flattened top view of a feline’s head. Folds of skin surround the eyes like goggles; the nose and upper part of the muzzle are added on one end, and two rounded ears perk up on the other. Such masks appear as finials on bracelets and pins, such as 164.1972, and as junctures on pins with open-cast heads and halberd axes, such as 1943.1318 (1).   Lion-headed bracelets are well known from representations, and some originals survive from the early first millennium BCE. In most cases, the finials are full heads rather than masks, but masks occur on a pair of gold bracelets from a Neo-Assyrian royal burial at Nimrud dated to the second half of the eighth century BCE (2). Closest to the Luristan bracelets is the ornament worn by king Adda-Hamiti-Inshushinak of Elam on a relief fragment from Susa (3). A traditional symbol of power, the lion was often an attribute of the king. The popularity of lion masks on the Luristan bronzes suggests that larger sections of the population used this imagery, although it cannot be excluded that it was reserved for objects intended for dedication to a deity. The relief from Susa indicates that lion-mask bracelets were current in the Elamite realm in the mid-seventh century BCE.    The Harvard fragments are all of different sizes. The smallest head, 1969.177.35.2, also differs stylistically from the others, in that its multiple eyebrows form a continuous line with the nose, separating the face into two halves. This is the more common rendering. The other three finials are modeled very cursorily. The chemical composition suggests that fragments 1969.177.36.A, 1969.177.36.B, and 1969.177.36.C may indeed have come from the same bracelet, even though the seemingly ancient breaks do not match well and the two heads differ in size. Alternatively, they may be fragments from different bracelets, but may have been made from the same batch of metal. The similarity in style and workmanship of the heads leaves little doubt that these were made by the same craftsman (4).   NOTES:   1. Compare P. R. S.

A strigil, which consists of a curved scoop with a handle, was a tool used in the baths for cleaning an individual’s body. Oil would be applied to a person’s skin and then removed, along with dirt or sweat, using the curved scoop of a strigil (2). The Apoxyomenos statue type, known from ancient literature as well as several copies including two over-life-size bronze versions, depicts an athlete cleaning the scoop of a strigil after use (3).   NOTES:   1. Although fragmentary, the find context of a Panathenaic amphora, dated to the fifth century BCE, indicates that the fragments may have come from a strigil similar to 1960.484, with a flattened handle bent to form a hook; compare D.

The other three edges are the result of irregular breaks. The back is smoothed and finished.   A Pan with pedum (shepherd's crook) in right hand and a nebris (animal skin) around shoulders appears to be prancing from right to left, looking back, in front of a tall, rectangular pillar with molded top. On this Doric pillar are two cloven feet from the small statue, cult image of Pan, which stood on top. At right, a plump Silenus raises his right arm and rests left on uncertain object, perhaps the neck of an ass. From the position of the two figures, Silenus higher than Pan, the former may be seated and riding backward on the animal.   A relief in the Museo Nazionale, Naples, Pan riding a mule or an ass in a rustic setting, shows the type of Graeco-Roman decorative panel represented by the Harvard fragment (Reinach, 1909-1912, III, p. 83, no. 5; Schreiber, 1894, pl. 54).

211929,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A stylized humanoid or simian figure sits atop a rod from around which project six tack-shaped knobs with flattened heads, forming four columns of six knobs each. The rod continues through a flattened circular element and ends in a large flattened tip with a convex exterior surface. The humanoid figure is hollow but has two short legs resting on the edge of a circular base. There are triangular spaces between the legs and the body. Two rod-shaped arms rise from the knees to meet a projecting rectangular tab that joins to a larger trapezoidal head at its top. The back of the figure is decorated with groups of four incised lines wrapping horizontally around the waist. Below it are two groups of similar incised lines that taper inward toward the bottom of the figure. Finally, two similar groups of identical incised lines mark the shoulders, tapering inward toward the base of the head.    This class of object is common among Macedonian assemblages of bronze ornaments from the eighth to seventh centuries BCE. Formerly termed “bottle-stoppers” (Kannenverschlüsse) by U. Jantzen, who thought the tack-shaped knobs would have been wrapped with cord or string and used to seal bottles containing liquids (1). They are now recognized to be pendants that hung from elaborate belts in sets, as M. Vickers has conclusively shown (2). These objects fall into two classes, an earlier one in which the seated simian figure is solid cast in the round (3), and a later abstract group, in which the seated figure is reduced to a thin plate and strip-like elements. Single seated figures with their hands held to their head are well known from central and southern Greece, such as a seated figure in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore (4). That figure holds an oval object to its face, but it is unclear whether this object is a piece of fruit or a musical instrument. A smaller figure on a circular base, formerly in the Leon Pomerance collection and now in a private collection in Beverly Hills, California, holds a cylindrical object projecting from the head that is most likely a musical instrument (5). This entire class of seated figures has Egyptian and Levantine predecessors, as P. Kranz and S. Langdon have demonstrated (6). The significance of these seated figures for Iron Age Greeks and Macedonians, however, remains unknown. As a class, they date from the eighth to the early seventh centuries BCE (7).    NOTES:   1.

The head and neck are undifferentiated, consisting of a simple bar connecting to the torso. Three small circles on the torso indicate nipples and navel, while the genitalia are modeled. The left arm is short (1.7 cm long) and tapers to a point (5mm down to 1 mm); the right arm is longer (2.7 cm) and broader (5 mm), with no taper, and ends in a hole used for attaching a weapon, likely a spear. The torso is flat and branches into two legs, which end with feet protruding in the front and tangs for insertion into a mount below them.   When the warrior originally came to the Harvard Art Museums, it had another element attached to the hole in the hand. This element proved to be the head of a similar figurine, although at a much smaller scale. The two have since been separated (see 1998.15.14.1).   Statues and statuettes of warriors in an attacking stance are quite common and range from highly developed—for instance Harvard’s 1977.216.2310—to very abstract, such as the present example (2).

A molded collar, 1992.256.137.B, has also been added to the top of the shaft; it is unclear whether this element is modern or if it may have belonged to another ancient object. The molded collar was removed, along with some of the filling covering the joins on the axe-head.   While the form and iconographic style of this axe-head are related to the Luristan bronze tradition, no figural parallels are known among axe-heads. Shaft-hole axe-heads are primarily associated with third-millennium BCE Mesopotamian and Iranian contexts, but these examples lack figural embellishment (1). The janiform heads adorning this object are of the same style seen on early first-millennium BCE Luristan tubes and finials, but they are not attested on axes (2). The heads on the Harvard axe-head are very worn and broken off at the top, and it is possible that they are also modern additions; ICP-MS/AAA analysis of the three currently joined components indicates that the decorative heads have a different alloy (bronze) than the blade or the shaft (both arsenical copper).

A vertical strut joins the blunt spikes. The ribs strengthen the upper and lower edges of the blade, which angles down to a convex cutting-edge. This object is formally very similar to an unexcavated example in the Ashmolean Museum (1).   Spiked-butt axe-heads represent a large and varied corpus of cast copper alloy weapons long attributed to Luristan and more recently excavated from burials at the Luristan sites of Bard-i Bal and Kutal-i Gulgul; related examples are found across the Near East (2). Axe-heads of this type average c. 20 cm in length and typically have four spikes projecting from the socket.

216945,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Portraying a mouflon striding to the left along a groundline, this cheekpiece was intended for the proper left side of a horse’s mouth. Sculpted in the round, the mouflon’s head is turned to face the viewer. Its thick horizontally incised horns rest atop its erect ears. The rather naturalistic face has recessed bead eyes and a damaged muzzle. The plain, low body features modeled haunches and a short tail.    The center of the mouflon’s torso is punctuated by a bit hole (1.3 cm in diameter) that is circumscribed by a ridge. Loops emerge on the top edge of the rear haunch and from behind the head; two conical spikes also project from the concave reverse.    Cheek pieces are components of equestrian gear that were worn on either side of a horse’s mouth (1). They are identified by a central hole through which a bit would have been secured. Cheek straps would have passed through loops at the top, and spikes on the undecorated reverse would have helped control the horse by digging into its cheeks.    Cast zoomorphic cheek pieces may have adorned, protected, and goaded horses. However, it is not clear that this gear was used or if it served specifically as funerary adornment in horse burials, as grave goods in human burials, or as votive objects (2). Although many cheek pieces are attributed to Luristan, no elaborate figural examples come from archaeological contexts (3). Simpler cheek pieces and harness components, however, have been excavated at various first-millennium BCE Iranian sites, including Hasanlu, Giyan, and Sialk (4).    Luristan-style zoomorphic cheek pieces typically feature obverse relief depictions of an animal striding on a groundline facing the direction in which the horse itself would have advanced. Horses, mouflons, and griffins, among other creatures, are represented—variations in imagery may have reflected the identity of the horse or rider, as well as regional and temporal differences.    Because right and left cheek pieces were made from separate molds and no in situ examples have been excavated, it is problematic to attempt to reconstruct matched pairs. Among the abundant figural cheek pieces classified as Luristan are probable forgeries and aftercasts (5).   NOTES:   1. See P. R. S.

A cylindrical stem rising from the top of the cage ends in a circular loop for suspension.    This small pendant is typical of cage pendants that occur in many sizes and varieties and were produced widely in Macedonia, Thrace, and the southern Balkans during the eighth to early seventh centuries BCE (1). Similar objects are also abundant in Iron Age bronze assemblages from western and northwestern Iran (2). Such cage pendants served as elements for necklaces, earrings, pectorals, and belts in Iron Age Macedonia, and they may have been decorations for horse harnesses as well. The fact that this pendant was part of the David N. Robinson bequest, however, may be evidence that this piece comes from Greece.    There is a strong possibility that these cage pendants represented fruit, especially the pomegranate, a symbol of the Underworld. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter states that Persephone had to return to the Underworld for six months each year because she had eaten a few pomegranate seeds (3). Late Geometric ceramic model pomegranates are known from Attica (4). However, the small size and rounded nature of the tip of this pendant make its identification as a pomegranate uncertain.

226193,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A single molding separates the lion mask from the hoop, which is semicircular to elliptical in section.    The highly stylized lion mask appears to have been the invention of Luristan metal smiths. It is essentially a flattened top view of a feline’s head. Folds of skin surround the eyes like goggles; the nose and upper part of the muzzle are added on one end, and two rounded ears perk up on the other. Such masks appear as finials on bracelets and pins, such as 164.1972, and as junctures on pins with open-cast heads and halberd axes, such as 1943.1318 (1).   Lion-headed bracelets are well known from representations, and some originals survive from the early first millennium BCE. In most cases, the finials are full heads rather than masks, but masks occur on a pair of gold bracelets from a Neo-Assyrian royal burial at Nimrud dated to the second half of the eighth century BCE (2). Closest to the Luristan bracelets is the ornament worn by king Adda-Hamiti-Inshushinak of Elam on a relief fragment from Susa (3). A traditional symbol of power, the lion was often an attribute of the king. The popularity of lion masks on the Luristan bronzes suggests that larger sections of the population used this imagery, although it cannot be excluded that it was reserved for objects intended for dedication to a deity. The relief from Susa indicates that lion-mask bracelets were current in the Elamite realm in the mid-seventh century BCE.    The Harvard fragments are all of different sizes. The smallest head, 1969.177.35.2, also differs stylistically from the others, in that its multiple eyebrows form a continuous line with the nose, separating the face into two halves. This is the more common rendering. The other three finials are modeled very cursorily. The chemical composition suggests that fragments 1969.177.36.A, 1969.177.36.B, and 1969.177.36.C may indeed have come from the same bracelet, even though the seemingly ancient breaks do not match well and the two heads differ in size. Alternatively, they may be fragments from different bracelets, but may have been made from the same batch of metal. The similarity in style and workmanship of the heads leaves little doubt that these were made by the same craftsman (4).   NOTES:   1. Compare P. R. S.

At left stands Minerva (Athena); her head is in profile to the right, and her torso is in three-quarter view. Her right arm is akimbo, while her left arm is bent and rests on the top of a circular shield. Her Corinthian helmet has a long crest, and she wears a peplos that is fastened at the shoulders and belted at the waist. The drapery clings to her legs. There is a curved form in the field above her left arm, and below the shield is a low column or altar. In the center of the disc, a half-draped woman is seated on a rock; she is facing right, and her torso is depicted in three-quarter view. She holds her right arm down at her side, hand behind her back, while her left arm is extended; a basket hangs from her elbow. Her hair is arranged in a bun and decorated by a diadem; a cloth is loosely draped over her thighs. The third woman stands at the right, with her head in profile to the left. Her body is frontal and forms a pronounced S-curve; she leans on a square column with her bent left arm. Her right arm is extended slightly toward the basket held by the seated woman. Her hair is pulled into a roll on the top of her head and possibly wrapped in a cloth. She wears an ankle-length, one-shouldered garment across her right shoulder that dips down on her torso to expose her left breast. Behind the figures, in lower relief, is a tree with leaves and fruit. A branch or weapon, a basket, and a mirror are depicted below the groundline; the objects seem to be paired with the women above them. Surrounding the scene are two raised bands. In the strip between the bands, olives, olive leaves, and what may be bunches of grain are depicted. The mirror surface is fairly well preserved on the reverse, with some minor chipping and dirt accretions.   The interpretation of the woman on the left as Minerva is clear from her clothing. The woman on the right is most likely to be Venus (Aphrodite) due to her clinging drapery and the mirror in the field below her. The figure in the center could be interpreted as Proserpina (Persephone/Kore) due to the bundles of wheat (1). This combination of figures would suggest that the scene depicts the moments prior to Proserpina’s abduction by Pluto (Hades) (2).   NOTES:   1. See G.

When viewed from the top, it is hard to recognize an animal in the simplified forms, but the bird and pose are immediately intelligible from the side. The underside is flat, as if the goose were swimming. There are two ribs at the join with the round, tapering shaft.

In the excavation report, the sleeping water bird is called a “duck.” In fact, the specimens from Surkh Dum have shorter necks, while the bird’s neck on the Harvard pin forms a loop like the horns of the gazelle’s heads on other Luristan pins (2). Sleeping water bird finials on pins and bracelets appear to have been an invention of Luristan metal smiths, and occurred throughout the late second and early first millennia BCE (3).

286014,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"These attachment hooks and plate fragments belong to a Samnite warrior's belt (1). There are at least fourteen belt plate fragments preserved, although it is difficult to count the fragments due to the poor preservation and the way it is sewn onto its canvas backing. It is unlikely that the full length of the plate is preserved (2). The plate fragments are flat, thin metal. One large fragment preserves six raised circular perforations in two rows for the adjustable attachment of hooks. The top and bottom of this fragment and most of the others also preserve borders of smaller perforations along the intact edges, which were used for sewing the belt plate onto a cloth or leather backing.    The two attachment hooks are in the shape of cicadas; the large eyes are concentric circles, and the wings are incised with fine lines and folded down. An iron rivet between the eyes would have been used to attach them to the belt plate; the perforation in the round tail of one of the hooks suggests that another rivet would have been present at the tail of each (3). Out of the head of each cicada springs a decorative band that becomes the stylized head of a dog. The dog's ears are molded, and the eyes are indicated; the long tongue protrudes from the open mouth to form the hook that would fasten to the belt. The bodies of the cicadas are thin metal and hollow on the underside; the neck and head of the dog are solid. The reconstructed placement of the two hooks may be correct: the plate under the bodies of the hooks bears faint outlines of their bodies, and there are some rust discolorations on the plate that correspond to the locations of the extant rivet holes in the hooks.   All four hooks in the Harvard collection are the same type and may have been made in the same workshop (4). The hooks may have had additional uses, evidenced by loose examples that have been found in graves and sanctuaries (5). The belts are typically found in male burials, sometimes in pairs (6), and they are depicted on contemporary vase and wall paintings (7).   NOTES:   1.

Both figures assume identical squatting positions typical of temple frieze iconography. The small scale and lack of inscription make identification of the deities difficult. The falcon-headed god on the proper right side probably represents Horus, who was associated with the falcon from the earliest periods of Egyptian history. The Double Crown with a ureaus and large spiral reinforce this identification, as Horus was intimately connected to the Egyptian king, who was perceived during his lifetime as the incarnation of Horus. His companion, who wears a sun disc with a uraeus, may be one of the fierce lioness goddesses, perhaps Sakhmet or Wadjet.

Comparable examples may be found in the area of Corinth, where the earliest strigils also have hollow, tubular handles, like this example, perhaps for the insertion of a wooden handle (1).   A strigil, which consists of a curved scoop with a handle, was a tool used in the baths for cleaning an individual’s body. Oil would be applied to a person’s skin and then removed, along with dirt or sweat, using the curved scoop of a strigil (2).

The end of the nose is missing. Drill points have been used in the ears and the tearducts of the eyes. The marble is from the northern Greek islands or western Asia Minor.   The boy has short hair, not deeply incised, and somewhat puffy jowls. The pupils of the eyes were doubtless finished in paint and seem to have been lightly incised, with large circles. The hair lies like a tight-fitting cap around the head.   The small size of this portrait suggests it was made as a memorial in a household shrine or a dedication at a small sanctuary, or in a tomb of modest proportions. It may have come from a draped figure standing in an aedicula or niche.   A slightly larger head of an older man, in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, comes from central Italy and could well have been made at the same time, for the same purpose (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 240, no. 376). Among the many comparable contemporary heads of Roman boys in the age of Imperial crisis, there is a head in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen (no. 766b), which Vagn Poulsen has identified as a novice in the cult of Isis, because of the long ringlets at the back, and as from the Greek provinces of the empire, because of the style (Poulsen, V., 1974, pp. 181-182, no. 187, pl. CCCIV). If the head in the Prince of Hesse's collection at Schloss Fasanerie near Fulda is really Severus Alexander between A.D. 223-225, then the Harvard portrait could be earlier and perhaps have Imperial connections (Heintze, 1968, pp. 69-70, 107, no.l 46, pls. 76, 132 a-c). Once the simple, veristic style of the post-Severan-baroque third century was established, portraits of boys aged about ten to fourteen tended to take on a certain timelessness, depending mostly on physical characteristics for individuality. Such seems to be the case here.   Cornelius Vermeule and Amy Brauer",NULL,NULL

The rectangular plaque is carved with two registers of figures, a thin fillet molding above the flat surfaces between and below, either side of the lower niche with the standing figure in the center. In the upper row, carved in sunken relief, are thirteen male figures standing frontally, holding spears vertically in the right hand and wearing helmets and what seem to be cloaks over cuirasses with skirts.

A similar male figure without the extra cloak and with arms spread out to the sides (in an orans gesture) stands frontally in the lower, central niche. On either side, in a long, thin, rectangular register, are six seated dogs (or possibly bears). They are shown in profile, each group facing toward the male figure in the center.

A circular puteal or wellhead in the Vatican Museums from a villa at Albano, as well as the famous marble krater signed by Salpion, in Naples, gives a rich repertory of figures surrounding the main group, including an old Silenus, dancing and flute-blowing satyrs, and a maenad beating on a tambourine (Lippold, 1956, pp. 240-244, pl. 112, 113).

This Athenian head has traditional elements in common with the heroes and priests or magistrates from the East Frieze of the Parthenon, but the complete work would have shown an Attic Stele in the conservative or revivalist style of the fourth century B.C.   On a stele in the Piraeus Museum (no. 386), Hippomachos stands at the left, extending his right hand to old Kallias who is seated to the left on an elegant chair.  This monument has been placed in a group dated around 380 BC, or very slightly later (Diepolder, 1931, p. 39, pl. 23).  The man on the left (Hippomachos) leans slightly forward toward his seated companion, presumably his old father.  Hair, rough beard, and face made to appear flat and round with large-lidded eyes and thick, parted lips of Hippomachos are all details that are exactly like those of the Watkins-Harvard head.  Indeed, it would seem this head came from a similar stele, probably carved by the same sculptor.  Jiří Frel has named him ""Le sculpteur de Chairedemos,” after the famous (two) walking-warrior relief of Chairedemos and Lykeas, also in the Piraeus Museum (no. 385) (Frel, 1969, pp. 23, 59, pl. VIII).  This stele was carved at the end of the fifth century B.C., thus forming the transition between the Athenian worlds before her final defeat by Sparta and the new vistas opened by the Macedonian attacks on the declining Persian Empire.

A large, scrolled vine fills this fragment, creating three separate circular zones. The beginning of another vine can be seen in the upper left corner. In the rightmost zone can be seen the heads and necks of two charging wolves and the head, neck, and torso of a third wolf. In the middle zone, a fourth wolf has caught the hind leg of a gazelle in his teeth. The gazelle, whose front half is in the left zone, turns its head and looks back and up over its shoulder. The hind part of a second gazelle can be seen fleeing to the left.   This work, currently installed in the stairwell of the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, is an exceptionally fine and sensitive rendering of a figured vine rinceau, a motif that occurs widely throughout the eastern Mediterranean from the Roman period on.

The cap (or the hair) behind curls around. The brow is smooth, suggesting this area may have been finished in paint.   This is a Severe Style head in miniature, from a small statue, perhaps of Hermes, with the petasos on his head and the wings attached where holes remain behind the ears. The fifth century B.C. antecedents of this head compare well with the so-called Strangford Apollo from Lemnos in the British Museum, about 485 B.C. (Vermeule, C., 1982, p. 223, fig. 189). The athletic victor in the Museo Civico, Agrigento, is the Sicilian counterpart of this Attic or Greek island god or youth (Hanfmann, 1967, p. 313, pl. 95).   A number of decorative herms flanking doorways in the houses of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and surrounding towns have something of the general aspect of this head, suggesting a date in the first century A.D. before the eruption of Vesuvius. The small size indicates a votive or funerary purpose, probably as part of a statuette. The archaistic and Severe Style qualities of this little head in a Pompeiian decorative context can be illustrated by a sculpture of unknown provenance, definitely not a forgery, in the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design (Ridgway, 1972, pp. 123, 235, no. 52).

There are two drill holes above the ears.  The hair is arranged in eleven curls around the forehead.  A number of heads of young gods or mortals--including the Apollo of the West Pediment at Olympia, a head in the Volos (Thessaly) Museum, and a head in the Cyrene Museum--are related, although no other has the exact arrangement of the curls around the forehead (Ridgway, 1970, pp. 57-58, figs. 73, 76-77, 80-83).  A nearly life-sized head, with a neck probably worked for insertion in a herm, from the Ludwig Pollak and Jacob Hirsch collections, shows how such heads appeared as early Roman imperial copies in marble on a full-sized scale (Ars Antiqua, A.G. no. 1, May 2, 1959, pp. 12-13, no. 30, pls. 13, 14).    A life-sized head (albeit damaged, with most of the area above the forehead missing) once seen in the Basel and Zurich art markets would suggest that the tiny head at Harvard probably came from Sicily (Andre Emmerich Gallery, Inc., 1975).  The tiny scale of this head, together with the fact that it is an original rather than a copy, suggests that this statue was carved in Sicily or Southern Italy between the Late Archaic and Transitional periods, a time when good marbles were relatively expensive in Western Greece.

Half of the krater's base is broken off, and the rim is chipped. There is a rectangular dowel hole in the center of the krater, and a pin hole for a repair of the edge above the satyr's head. There are drill marks in the hair and the eyes are hollowed out.   This support is in the form of a head of a laughing, smiling satyr balancing a krater on his shoulders, with drapery between. The drilling of the hair and the hollowed-out eyes support a date in the Flavian or more likely Antonine to Severan periods of the Roman Empire. Satyrs as supports for garden fountains and decorative tables in the courtyards of Roman villas were popular in the country estates of Imperial Rome, especially in the villas along the Alban Hills. An example in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen, has the satyr grasping his panther skin, which is rolled around the water basin on his left shoulder. The satyr himself was drilled for a water pipe in this marble ensemble from a Roman villa (Hadrian's?), below the Villa d'Este at Tivoli (Poulsen, 1951, p. 345, no. 485, pl. XXXVI). The motif of the satyr balancing a krater on his shoulder (all as part of a larger ensemble, a furniture support) developed out of the Hellenistic group of the satyr carrying the infant Dionysos on his shoulder, a statue that existed in mirrored pairs or reversals (Brizzolara, 1982, pp. 178-179, illus.). A variant in Berlin, a lion-footed table leg, shows the satyr's head tilted back in the same fashion as here, an animal (goat?) draped and carried around his shoulders in the good shepherd motif (Conze, 1891, pp. 425-426, no. 1074, seemingly from Italy).   The motif of the satyr carrying a krater on one shoulder occurs in a larger, wider context in the scenes of Antonine and Severan triumph on Dionysos sarcophagi, where satyrs old and young are bringing such vases home from India. Sometimes these kraters or flatter, wider bowls, have handles in the form of lions or panthers climbing into them, all designed to suggest the exotic metalwork of the ancient Near East, the vases created by Greek, Persian, and Parthian craftsmen in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquests. A Dionysiac relief in the Museo Nazionale, Naples, with the god and his satyrs and maenads in intoxicated revels, has a satyr on the left end, seen from the back and hefting a krater just as the satyr of the trapezophoros or loutrophoros in the Harvard Art Museum (Reinach, 1909-1912, p. 68, no. 4).   The repertory of these supports extended to the iconography of barbarians as well as Dionysiac figures, including the kneeling Persians or Scythians carrying large, elaborate vases on their shoulders. A heavily restored example in the Galleria dei Candelabri of the Vatican show the remains of a centaur holding a krater as in the Harvard piece (Lippold, 1956, pp. 180-182, no. 37, pl. 85, also pp. 332-333, no. 74, pl. 146).

The head and neck were made separately to be inserted in the hollow between the shoulders. The left arm appears to have been attached with a dowel at the shoulder, while the right arm was joined in a similar manner a little farther down the start of the upper arm. The legs are missing above the knees. The dent on the lower part of the left hip, at the break, could be the remains of a strut connecting with an upside-down dolphin or a draped urn, the usual attributes of Aphrodite.   This Aphrodite is a sensitive version of the type best represented by the Aphrodite of the Troad in the Museo Nazionale Romano, from the Palazzo Chigi, a second century A.D. copy of the Hellenistic prototype. The Aphrodite of the Troad, so inscribed on the Chigi copy (together with the information that Menophantos made the original or, more likely, this copy), is related to the Aphrodite in the Museum at Cyrene. The Cyrene statue, which has a large, inverted dolphin against the lower hip (the end of the tail) and the left leg (the creature's body), goes back through the Aphrodite of the Museo Capitolino in Rome to the original of the Medici Venus in the Tribuna of the Uffizi in Florence.   Along the roads back from the Aphrodite of the Troad and the Aphrodite of Cyrene to the work of Lysippos (the Capitoline Aphrodite) or the creativity of Skopas (the Medici Venus), there were statues in cities from Attica to Asia Minor and beyond which mixed the proportions, details, attributes, and supports of a variety of Aphrodites. By various routes, they all arrived finally at the great source for all such figures of the goddess of love and beauty, portrayed as if stepping from her sponge bath or the sea, namely the Knidia of Praxiteles, made around 350 to 340 B.C.

The marble is Dolomitic from Thasos, Saliari area, probably from the Aliki quarries (J.J. Herrmann, Jr.).     This head, in the Ionian style of the Archaic Artemision at Ephesos, comes from a semicircular monument, the drum of a column, or a votive base.  Another fragment of the same monument, an East Greek Kouros of the Samian style, is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.  It is also unfinished (Vermeule, C., January 1971, p. 38, figs. 44-45; Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 15, no. 22, 69.982).    The presumption is that the monument or group of sculptures to which these heads belonged was left unfinished on account of disturbances connected with the Ionian revolt and the Persian wars.     On the analogy of the Archaic column drums from the Artemision at Ephesos, around 540 BC, this head can be seen as coming from a thin, long-garmented figure walking from left to right on the semicircular surface (Boardman, 1978, p. 62, fig. 57; Homann-Wedeking, 1968, pp. 120-121, fig. 25).  The head in Boston, however, comes from a plumper figure, akin to the men from the Geneleos base at the Heraion on Samos, dated about 560 BC (Homann-Wedeking, 1968, pp. 93-94, fig. 17).

She wears a chiton and himation and is shown facing, a lei-like wreath clutched in her lowered left hand. Her hair is arranged around her forehead and is brought up to a peak or knot at the back of her head. She also wears earrings, a choker-like necklace, a bracelet on her right hand that emerges from the fold of her cloak, a ring on her right ring finger, and one or more rings on her left fingers. The niche takes the form of a curved apse with entablature running behind the woman's head near the top of her hairdo and a large, fluted shell against the semicircle of the top of the niche, like a halo above the woman's hair.   The large, almond eyes, once painted, indicate the primitivism of the carving. The style of wearing the hair was influenced by the iconography of Faustina I, wife of Antoninus Pius (died A.D. 141), and, allowing for a generation in the transmission of styles, this similarity suggests the date for this relief, a tombstone.   The costume, pose, and setting document the Hellenistic influences on Romano-Egyptian sculpture and mark the transition toward the linear, decorative style of so-called ""Coptic"" sculpture, carving of the Christian period in Egypt.   The quality of such funerary monuments in painted limestone varies considerably. A high-relief, fragmentary bust of a young lady in Boston stands at the top end of the scale (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 231, no. 364), while a full-length figure of a woman is even flatter, almost like a proto-Coptic painted panel or textile. The full-length, painted-stone lady in the Museum of Fine Arts comes from Behnessa-Oxyrhynchas (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1973, p. 49, 1972.875). Such limestone figures of Egyptians of the Roman Imperial period, in or out of their niches, stand at the end of the evolutionary process in Egyptian painted, sculpted, and multi-media funerary portraitures (Parlasca, 1966, pl. 1, fig. 2, pl. 62).

The final element, located just above the clasp, is in the form of rectangular cuff. These decorations might represent armlets and bracelets. The hand-shaped clasp, which is an attribute of Near Eastern fibulae dated no earlier than the seventh century BCE (Stronach’s Type IV), has clearly articulated fingers and a detached thumb (1). The accentuated apex, marked here by a vertical rib, is another indicator of this mature type, which became the standard form in the Achaemenid period (c. 539-331 BCE). This fibula bears a striking resemblance to an example in the Godard Collection that was acquired in Iran (2). It is also similar to a fibula excavated from an Iron Age III Luristan tomb at the site of Cham Sul (3).   Fibulae were worn at the chest or shoulder to fasten garments, similar to a safety pin. They sometimes also served to secure pendants suspended from chains (4). These devices first came into use in the Near East near the end of the second millennium BCE, when they were probably introduced by eastern Mediterranean merchants. The earliest fibulae excavated in Mesopotamia and Iran are dated to the eighth century BCE. Fibulae appear more frequently in Near Eastern contexts of the seventh century and later, when they surpassed the straight pin in popularity. Most Near Eastern fibulae have a triangular bow, as seen in the Harvard examples. Fibulae of this form, sometimes referred to as “elbow” -shaped, belong to Type XIII of Blinkenberg’s classification and to Types III and IV of Stronach’s typology (5).   Near Eastern elbow fibulae vary in size and detail, but in general, they are relatively plain and usually have bead-and-reel decoration. The arms of the bow are often of slightly unequal lengths, with the longer one terminating in a catchplate that sometimes takes the form of a human hand. The spring typically consists of a triple loop that extends into a round, tapered, and pointed pin. Fibulae were often produced from two pieces that were joined by inserting the pin into the bow.   The Harvard fibulae can be generally compared with Neo-Assyrian examples from the Mesopotamian sites of Nimrud, Nineveh, and Khorsabad, as well as with Iranian examples from Iron Age III levels at the Luristan sites of War Kabud, Sar Kabud, Cham Sul, Dam Chaft, and Tepe Nush-i Jan, among others (6). Although separate production centers probably existed, it appears Mesopotamia and Iran used similar fibula types, making it difficult to assign provenience to unexcavated pieces (7).   NOTES:   1. D.

The head is broken away irregularly at the start of the neck. The surfaces of the bald head and face are weathered. Ears, nose, and mouth have suffered likewise. The circles of the pupils were carved lightly and must have been finished in paint. Drill points mark the inner corners of the eyes and outer corners of the mouth. The head is worked all around, indicating it came from a free-standing ensemble rather than a tomb monument with figures in high relief.   A similar sculpture, the old soldier Publius Gessius, from a three-person family tomb-relief in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is more drawn in his facial features, and has the same lightly carved eyes finished with paint. The man in Boston, carved in limestone-like Italian marble, shows something of the same ethos on a cruder level. The portrait in Palombino from Rome has a nearly similar delineation of the inner corners of the eyes and the outer ends of the mouth (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, pp. 200-202, nos. 319-321).   The date suggested, 50-30 B.C., may be a decade or two too early, although this head belongs without any doubt to the decades before the classicism of the Augustan age influenced private portraiture. Roman tomb-reliefs with older people in this veristic style and younger persons in the new fashions based on the Polykleitan to Hellenistic Greek tradition indicate such a stylistic shift was in full swing by about 2 BC (Richter, 1948, nos. 2, 3, 4 [veristic style], nos. 5, 6 [Augustan influences]). The head, however, belongs to the most ""fact-bound"" style of late Roman Republican portraiture. While Greek sculptors had carved such heads on ideal bodies at Delos and elsewhere in places where Roman clientele settled, the origins of this portraiture combined Egyptian taste and traditions of carving with the conventional Roman leaning to truth and simplicity and directness in representing specific individuals. Such concepts of portraiture can be traced back through Italic art to Etruscan funerary monuments around 300 B.C.   Cornelius Vermeule and Amy Brauer",NULL,NULL

Small, provincial heads of divinities and others from Egypt or Cyprus (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 121, no. 185), from mainland Greece or the Aegean islands (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 122, no. 188), and from Asia Minor by way of Istanbul, of the divinities Men or Attis (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 143, no. 229) show the same large eyes outlined by simple, heavy lids, summary hair in a retrospective style, compressed lips, and direct, unemotional frontality.       Whatever its antecedents, this head appears have been carved in the Roman Imperial period, probably in Asia Minor some time during the first century or first half of the second.  Simple though they may be, and of indifferent quality in terms of Greek sculpture of the fifth century BC through the Hellenistic age, heads such as this provided a bridge to the Late Antique, proto-Byzantine statues and relief in the Greek Imperial world.

The back or crown of the head was broken off, cut down, and restored; half the restoration remains. The base of the neck is cut to fit into a terminal shaft. The surfaces are chipped, worn, or weathered, and have been cleaned. Some scholars according to notes in the object file have questioned the antiquity of this head.   Sophocles lived from about 496 to 406 B.C., reaching the height of his political and intellectual career in Athens around 436 BC. Seven complete plays and fragments of others survive from his lifetime production of over 120 plays. The Athenians honored him as a hero after his death.   This head is of the so-called ""Farnese"" type of Sophocles and takes its name from a herm in the Farnese Collection of the Museo Nazionale, Naples. The Farnese portrait was found in Rome, in the Via Ostiense (Richter, 1965, 1, p. 127, no. 17). The ideal likeness was intended to show Sophocles at about sixty years of age, in 436 BC when Pheidias and Perikles were finishing the Parthenon. The many copies vary widely in quality, from those with the softness of an elder on an Attic grave stele (no. 22, Copenhagen) to those with the metallic harshness and stringiness of the David M. Robinson head (no. 11, Villa Albani). This example wears a fillet or diadem.   Nothing is known of the complete statue from which this head derives, for most of the copies of the head that survive are based on garden herms.  However, in support of the antiquity of the Robinson head is the suggestion that it came from a very late and provincial garden herm, like some of those found in the ruins of country villas and parks in Roman Gaul.  This head might even have been carved as late as the fourth century of the Roman Empire, in the time of Constantine the Great or Constantius II (A.D. 306 to 337 to 361), when ancient learning was as much admired as it had been in the earlier centuries of the Hellenistic and Roman world.  A head of the ""Farnese"" Sophocles in the collection of Mr. Gilbert Denman, Jr., in San Antonio, Texas, has been recognized as a copy of the Greek original made in the third century A.D.; the original dates from the outset of Hellenistic are in the fourth century BC, about the time when the young Macedonian Alexander the Great was being educated in the great Greek literature of the time (Hoffman, 1970, pp. 75-77, under no. 23).  The Denman head has the same rigidity as the D. M. Robinson Sophocles, although the former, sawed from a double herm (with Euripides) has the same drill-work found in Roman sarcophagi from Severus Alexander through Gallienus (A.D. 222 to 268).

The head and lower legs are missing.  There are patches on the chest repaired in plaster.    The forms of the area from the waist to the knees are suggestive of the section of a kouros found in the tumulus of Pietrera at Vetulonia and now in the Archaeological Museum, Florence.  It was made of pietra fetida, a stone of local nature (Hus, 1961, pp. 30, 127-133, pl. 1).  The face of the Robinson kouros with head preserved can be paralleled in the head of a sphinx in the Musee du Louvre, from Vulci, no. 2054 (Hus, 1961, p. 42, no. 11, pl. xxiv), and a double-herm in Florence, no. 73.138, from Orvieto (Hus, 1961, p. 84, no. 1, pl. xxxvii).  The first statue is made of nenfro, and the second sculpture is carved in trachyte.    In summation, the increased understanding of local, Archaic sculptures in Etruria suggest that the two Robinson statues, as well as other heretofore unclassified, ""rustic"" works of Archaic art in rough stones, belong in the ""twilight"" world (made so by illicit excavation) of Etruria, rather than in any obscure, undocumented Sicilian antiquarian ""red herring"" of an alleged provenance.  In truth, these statues could have been set up in the same way as all the more common Etruscan animals, real and fantastic (leopards, lions, sphinxes, hippocamps, and a centaur), along the dromoi or atop the entrances of Etruscan tombs at Vulci and nearby areas.

The raised right arm was attached with a dowel at the right shoulder. The surfaces have dents and abrasions, and there is weathering that has brought out the crystalline structure of the marble.  Much of the back from waist to upper thighs is cut away. The back is carved in a flat profile to begin with. Supports and/or attributes joined the outer legs along the thighs.   There are many variations of this small figure of Aphrodite who was probably raising her arms to wring out her tresses. Sometimes these figures, which are associated with the art of Alexandria and do turn up in considerable numbers in Egypt, as well as Asia Minor, have drapery around the lower limbs, as if her cloak had slipped down by accident or in connection with a bath.  An example in Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen, demonstrates this (Poulsen, 1951, p. 603, no. 868, pl. XVI). Variations of Aphrodite Anadyomene are collected and discussed by Brinkerhoff (Brinkerhoff, 1978, pp. 170-177), perhaps as a late Hellenistic, classicizing creation originating in or around the island of Rhodes and soon spreading to the statuette workshops of Alexandria in Egypt.  Some have tried to suggest that the half-draped type is a century earlier than the nude Anadyomene, the former going back to the period around 250 BC, while the latter belongs to the beginning of the late Pergamene period or Hellenistic rococo.  Others reverse the sequence and put the unclothed Aphrodite emerging from the sea back in the workshop of Lysippos's disciples such as Eutychides, about 280 BC. (Brinkerhoff, 1978, pp. 170-177; Budde, Nicholls, 1964, pp. 53-54, under nos. 85, 86, pl. 27, both from Egypt; Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, p. 116, under no. 178 A).     The late Hellenistic and Greek imperial worlds played with and produced numerous variations of the type, not only in attributes and minor details of pose but in such mechanical tours de force as mirror reversal. Indeed, a larger counterpart, identical in style but with everything reversed, was found in Sardis (Hanfmann, Ramage, 1978, p. 107, no. 111, fig. 237).  A more vertical, more static version of Aphrodite holding her hair in her right hand and an alabastron in the left (therefore with the left shoulder level with the right instead of lowered, as in the Rowland torso) was found in a villa near Narbonne in France and has been dated in the Constantinian age, pushing the subject to the end of pagan antiquity (Brinkeroff, 1970, p. 36, fig. 47).

The tip of the nose, the chin, and a section over the middle of the forehead have been damaged.  There are traces of red paint.     The figure wears a tight turban or cloth, earrings, a necklace, and a tunic or cloak.  There is a late Archaic or Transitional fringe of curls over the forehead and a face that echoes the Ionian styles of the time of the Persian Wars.  Hair and face are softened by the fleshy neck and humanized by a turban that belongs to the period after the Parthenon frieze.  These peculiarities, especially the fringe of archaizing curls, continue in Cypriote votive sculpture in the fourth century BC and of Hellenistic periods, the pupils of the eyes were flat for finishing in plaster and paint.   Small heads from the first L.P. di Cesnola Collection in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, document the development of this style of hair and rendering of eyes, from about 470 BC well into or even through the Hellenistic period (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, pp. 273, 276, 277, nos. 437, 442, 445, 446).  Since styles on Cyprus were derivative of several sources and slow to change, heads such as this are often dated up to fifty years earlier than their probable dates of carving.  The points of departure are the so-called ""female votaries"" of the Persian period, 535-332 BC.  Those with cloth headdresses (British Museum, Type 33) are generally dated in the period 470-400, but variations continue later, as seems to be the case here (Pryce, 1931, pp. 104-112, especially pp. 107-108, c298, c299, both earlier examples).   The male counterpart of this head, albeit clearly a carving of about 450-430 BC in the Ionian Archaic style, is the figure in a long tunic and red cloak from a sanctuary near the village of Mandres in the Famagusta district and later in the Pierides collection, Larnaca, Cyprus (Karageorghis, 1973, pp. 86, 145-146, no. 92).  The large ears and the neck are unadorned, but the facial expression is similar, in a timeless fashion.  The Cypriote sources for the Harvard head can be found in various early Classical sculptures from the Peloponnesus, Sicily, Southern Italy, and, of course, the Greek islands leading to Western Asia Minor (Fuchs, 1969, pp. 254-257, figs. 279-283).

Details are rendered in a soft, summary fashion.   The face of this young warrior is fairly long, and the cheeks plump.  The stiff, vertical, and somewhat frontal qualities of the head suggest that it was once part of a Hellenistic dedicatory or votive stele. Many of these stelai, and their counterparts for funerary purposes, show the subjects in frontal poses in architectural settings, as an example probably from Asia Minor in the Graf Lanckoronski collection in Vienna of a man of intellectual and athletic rather than military tendencies (Pfuhl, Möbius, 1977, I, p. 108, no. 254, II, p. 48); another, similar and helmetless head of a young man is on a stele in Istanbul from Madytos in the Thracian Chersonnesus (Pfuhl, Möbius, 1977, I, pp. 163-164, no. 538, II, pl. 83).  The man ought to have been in the military service of a Hellenistic ruler or city, but Roman military personnel were buried in the Greek islands, Thrace, and Western Asia Minor at a date earlier than the imperial period.   This head is a good carving, in a traditional style found widely.  The ultimate influence of Severe Style heads about 460 B.C. from Southern Italy or Sicily can be seen by comparison with a female figure with helmet-like headdress in the Museo Barracco, Rome (Schefold, Cahn, 1960, pp. 218, 220, no. 243, also pp. 58-59).

The horse’s long head, shown in profile, is sculpted in the round. It features a linear indentation across the round muzzle, recessed bead eyes, erect ears, and a short, thick stylized mane with a projecting forelock. The slim tail falls to the ankle but has suffered a c. 3-mm loss in the middle. Incised lines define the leg joints. The front and back haunches are modeled, and the hindquarters are embellished with an incised spoke pattern. Incised and in relief, a cord, probably with a bell, is depicted around the neck. No mate is known for this object, but it fits comfortably within the large corpus of Luristan zoomorphic cheek pieces, some of which portray horses wearing a collar or bell (1).    The center of the horse’s torso is punctuated by a bit hole (1.5 cm in diameter) that is circumscribed by a ridge and shows wear. Loops emerge on the top edge of the rear haunch and from behind the head; two conical spikes also project from the concave reverse.    Cheek pieces are components of equestrian gear that were worn on either side of a horse’s mouth (2). They are identified by a central hole through which a bit would have been secured. Cheek straps would have passed through loops at the top, and spikes on the undecorated reverse would have helped control the horse by digging into its cheeks.    Cast zoomorphic cheek pieces may have adorned, protected, and goaded horses. However, it is not clear that this gear was used or if it served specifically as funerary adornment in horse burials, as grave goods in human burials, or as votive objects (3). Although many cheek pieces are attributed to Luristan, no elaborate figural examples come from archaeological contexts (4). Simpler cheek pieces and harness components, however, have been excavated at various first-millennium BCE Iranian sites, including Hasanlu, Giyan, and Sialk (5).    Luristan-style zoomorphic cheek pieces typically feature obverse relief depictions of an animal striding on a groundline facing the direction in which the horse itself would have advanced. Horses, mouflons, and griffins, among other creatures, are represented—variations in imagery may have reflected the identity of the horse or rider, as well as regional and temporal differences.    Because right and left cheek pieces were made from separate molds and no in situ examples have been excavated, it is problematic to attempt to reconstruct matched pairs. Among the abundant figural cheek pieces classified as Luristan are probable forgeries and aftercasts (6).   NOTES:   1. See P. R. S.

289404,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This winged figure may represent Isis as a protective figure; her pose indicates that she would have been part of a group composition, with her arms held out to protect another figure in front of her. Her face is rather crudely modeled with a horizontal slit for the mouth and a flat nose. She wears the sun disc atop double circlets (the “modius crown”) with a vestigial uraeus on the upper circlet. Wings with ambiguous arm-like appendages along the top extend straight out in front, almost perpendicular to the body. Roughly incised feathers mark the outside surfaces; the inner surfaces remain unadorned and probably would have sheltered another figure, such as Osiris or the Apis bull (1). In the later periods, Isis was considered the mother of the Apis bull, which after its death became associated with Osiris. Excavated examples of winged goddesses have been found at the Serapeum of Saqqara, the cult center for the Memphite Osiris-Apis (2). The proper left wing is broken at the join with the body. A pair of feet on a square base with peg below had been attached in modern times, but it may not belong to the figure. The metal is yellow, which may indicate that this piece is a modern creation.   A small kneeling male figure, 1969.177.15.D, was also associated with this Isis figurine and base when acquired. The figure holds his arms, bent at the elbows, in front of his torso palms down, the left hand slightly higher than the right. He may wear a headpiece, giving his head a bulbous profile in the back, or have a shaven head. Small eyes, nose, and mouth are visible—the ears are disproportionately large, with horizontal lines at the center. The lower legs are clearly shown drawn up under the upper legs. The bottoms of the feet are visible at the back, rendered with a space between them; below the feet and connecting them is a small tang for insertion into a base or mount.   Whether or not the kneeling figure and the winged figure belonged together in antiquity, this type of group, with a small adorant kneeling before a much larger deity, and each separately inserted into a single base, is known from several examples (3).

The head is broken, irregularly, through the neck. The eyes were probably inlaid, as they remain hollow. The top of the head is made separately, a tight join.   The diadem is similar to that worn by Alexander the Great in the marble head from Egypt in Boston. The hair is in two rows of curls around the forehead. Hair and beard are cut in rough curls, round and irregular. The ears are large and pulled slightly forward. The face has a high polish.   Mithridates I is a celebrated Philhellene known from his coins. This head from a small statue, a bust, or even the top of a scepter-staff, seems to have been carved at Babylonia where the pertinent coins, as well as those issued under Mithridates II about 122-121 B.C., were struck. The stone was used in these regions in neo-Sumerian times, c. 2100 B.C., for heads and statues of rulers and officials in the time of Judea and others (Terrace, 1962, no. 9). D. M. Robinson suggested that the eyes were made of ivory, with asphalt lining, as in the case of other statuettes from this part of the world in Parthian times.    While the details of hair, face, and beard identify this head as that of a famous, early Parthian king, and while the material is peculiar to lower Mesopotamia or Iran, coins show us that Mithridates I and others issued silver tetradrachms and drachms that placed them firmly in the traditions of Alexander the Great and their Seleucid predecessors and contemporaries. A series of tetradrachm struck at Seleucia on the Tigris River combines the king's diademed, draped bust in profile to the right on the obverse with a typical standing Hellenistic Herakles holding cup (skyphos) and club on the reverse (The Garrett Collection, Part II, Bank Leu AG, Zurich, October 16-18, 1984, p. 68, no. 313, pl. 20; Wroth, 1903, pp. 12-15, pl. iii; Sellwood, 1971, pp. 25, 38, etc.; Richter, 1984, p. 247). Mithridates II of Parthia struck tetradrachms, with a portrait very much like this small head in profile to the left on the obverse, also at Seleucia on the Tigris from 123 to 91 BC. Here Herakles on the reverse has been replaced by what had been introduced earlier and would become the standard type for the series, a Parthian archer seated (on an omphalos?, later a throne) testing his bow (Jenkins, 1972, pp. 272, 274, 276, fig. 667; Garrett Collection, loc. cit. no. 314; Wroth, 1903, p. 24, pl. vi.

A break through the waist has been mended.    This small statue has been called ""Sikel"" sculpture as a way of explaining the awkward style and carving.  The face has a strong Archaic smile with a thick lower lip.  Something of this regional identification may have been conditioned by the alleged attribution of this and the following statue to inland Sicily.  Material and style might better associate them with the art of the Etruscans around 500 BC, a precise date being difficult to determine because of delayed uses of current late Archaic Greek models by the sculptors of Vulci and surrounding areas.  Generally speaking, were this statue to have been fashioned in Southern Italy or Sicily, as in the majority of surviving examples, it would have been carved in imported Greek marble or fashioned in terracotta.  The kouros from Megara Hyblaea in Geneva was worked from marble quarried on the island of Chios (Schefold, Cahn, 1960, pp. 213-214, no. 234b, dated around 490 BC).  The earlier, more famous torso from the same region, in the Museo Nazionale, Syracuse, was carved from Parian marble and has a strong resemblance to the statue discussed in the following entry (Schefold, Cahn, 1960, pp. 146, 173, no. 111a).

The underside of the neck appears to have been finished fairly smoothly in antiquity.  A ribbon or fillet, just in front of the veil, hold her hair in place.  The nose and a piece of the lower lip are restored; two pieces in the neck have been patched on again.  The relief dates from near the end of the fourth century series, about 320 BC; it has been dated and termed ""about 320 by the sculptor of the stele in Budapest"" (J. Frel, in a letter of 15 June, 1973).  It appears that this head came from a monument so large that head and neck were worked separately and set into the body, as was the custom with veiled statues, like the Demeter of Knidos, in the fourth century BC.  Otherwise, with a provenance in Rome, this head could have been broken or cut from a big Attic stele in antiquity, remounted or refinished as a bust or even a herm, and treasured by Roman Imperial collector.  A similar fate appears to have befallen the woman from a big Attic funerary monument, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (Comstock, Vermeule, 1976, pp. 48-49, no. 70).  A number of big Attic stelai relate to this head in the Harvard University Art Museums.  The example in the Budapest Museum of Art show a woman of matronly aspect (whose head has been broken off) shaking hands with a bearded elder, an aging athlete or an older hero, who is presented in the heroic nude, cloak on his left shoulder and wrapped around his left arm.  A boy, a servant with an offering in hand, stands cross-legged between them (Diepolder, 1931, p. 55, pl. 49, no. 2).    Other big stelai, usually with their heads carved in one piece with their bodies, show the type of Athenian matron represented here, standing or seated in very high relief against a flat background or an architectural setting made separately.  The stele of Demetria and Pamphile from the Kerameikos in Athens is a perfect example (Diepolder, 1931, pp. 53-54, pl. 51, no. 1).

The back of the head and helmet are missing from behind the right ear.    This head is a Roman copy of an original of ca. 430-420 B.C., known as the Ares Borhese. The head is wearing an Attic helmet with visor and rudimentary crest.  The roughened yet cold surfaces and the drill points at the inner corners of the pupils of the eyes date this copy in the Trajanic period, ca. A.D. 110.   Replicas of the Ares Borghese, associated with Alkamenes about 420 BC, are discussed in connection with the statue found in Building M at Side in 1950 (Inan, 1975, pp. 47-50, no. 10, pl. xxii; Inan, 1975a, pp. 69-71, no. 1).  The fact that the statue has been found in decorative and official contexts at a wide variety of locations around the Graeco-Roman world, from Italy to Asia Minor and North Africa, shows that the original was famous, certainly attributable to one of the major masters working in Athens a decade or so after the Parthenon was finished (Picard, 1939, 11, 1, p. 250, 11, 2, pp. 578-580. fig. 237 Louvre).     The complete statue, showing the god or a young hero in divine guise, may have been made for the cults of Ares expanded in Attica as a result of the Peloponnesian Wars.  The slender, athletic figure stands with weight on the left leg, left hip thrown out, right arm and hand lowered to the side, and left arm flexed with hand grasping the spear.  The figure takes its name from the marble copy in the Louvre, Paris, which came from the Borghese collection in Rome (Fuchs, 1969, pp. 94-96, fig. 86).   Jenifer Neils has recently suggested that the Ares Borghese may be a statue of Theseus on the basis of three characteristics: hairstyle, ankleband and stance (Neils, 1988, pp. 155-158).

This is a Roman version of one of the statues associated with Lysippos, a figure grasping a club in the left hand and wearing a lionskin like a cloak over the left shoulder and arm. The right hand (all of the right arm is gone) presumably held the apples of the Hesperides against the right rear buttock.   Among the many copies and variants of Weary Herakles, rustic examples such as this have been found in Gaul, western Germany, North Africa, and Asia Minor. A section of an Attic relief of the Roman Imperial period in Leiden show a Herakles of this type, grasping his club in similar fashion.

There are drillmarks in the interior corners of the eyes, nostrils, edges of the mouth, ears, and curls of hair. The surface has been reworked (Guntram Koch).   The helmeted head is tilted back and to the left. The face has a pained expression, with furrowed brow and a slightly opened, Skopaic mouth.   There are many parallels for this head, which came from an Attic battle sarcophagus. One (tilted downward instead of upward) belongs to the Greek on horseback, raising his sword to strike, on the Attic sarcophagus with Amazonomachy in the Museum at Thessaloniki (Giuliano, 1962, p. 44, no. 217, photograph on cover). A similarly helmeted head of identical dimensions, with a polish to the surfaces, was thought to be perhaps an Amazon from a sarcophagus of the late Antonine to early Severan periods (Johnson, 1931, p. 120, no. 243).

The breaks are clean. The surfaces are fresh. Remains of chiseling on the exterior run horizontally between the outer edge of the lip and the top of the tongues.   The rim is enriched with broad egg-and-dart molding rising from a band of reels along the inner edge. The ends of concave tongue fluting are visible along the body below the outward curve of the lip or outer edge of the rim. One such complete marble krater, ""vase of life,"" dated in the fourth to early fifth century A.D., has survived to document this decorative art in late antique, early Christian times, aside from representations in relief and other media (Weitzmann, 1979, pp. 334-336, no. 314). A seemingly complete example in the Musée du Louvre has a rich rim and acanthus leaves on the lower body. This krater seems to date from the earlier part of the Roman Empire, perhaps Hadrianic times (about AD 125) (Reinach, 1897-1930, I, p. 132, top right). The same is probably true of an example at the entrance to the Vatican Museums Lippold, 1956, p. 18, no. 14, pl. 3).   Garden and cemetery kraters of this shape, based on metalwork, go back to the beginnings of the Roman Empire, as demonstrated by the example found on the Via Appia near the tomb of Caecilia Metella. Here the floral enrichment is related to the lower outside panels of the Ara Pacis Augustae as well as to silver cups from the Boscoreale treasure and from Caesarea in Cappadocia (Jones, 1912, pp. 104-105, Galleria no. 31a, pl. 28). The bowls on the tops of the Barberini candelabra in the Vatican, although flatter, have the same sort of convex fluting on their outsides (Bieber, 1977, p. 213, pl. 146, figs. 851-854).   The same forms of enrichment were used for flat fountain basins as for deep kraters among the marble garden sculptures of the area around Rome. A fragment of unknown provenance in Rome demonstrates these decorative parallels in the shape of a dish like the bird-baths produced in the modern ateliers working with Carrara marble in the suburbs of Rome (Cima, 1982, pp. 138-139, no.

The right arm and chest from shoulder to waist remain.    A lock of hair is visible on the shoulder of this figure, moving from left to right like Virtus on a large hunting sarcophagus. A bracelet is also visible on the right, upper arm, and the drapery (himation) has fallen around the waist, although the chiton (pinned on the right shoulder) covers the right breast. This is not a characteristic of Amazonian figures on big sarcophagi.   The sarcophagus with symbolic hunting scenes, about A.D. 230, in the Palazzo Mattei, Rome, has a figure of Virtus following the imperatorial hunter on horseback. Although the chiton has slipped from the right breast, the pose is identical with that of this fragment (Vermeule, C., 1978, pp. 140-141, 198, 365, fig. 148).   This figure may also be identified as a fragment from a sarcophagus depicting the myth of Achilles on Skyros. It shows a daughter of Lykomedes rather than an Amazon, Roma, or similar symbolic figure. The thickness of the background suggests a large sarcophagus or commemorative relief.   On other sarcophagi representing Achilles on Skyros, one of the daughters of Lykomedes typically holds out her arm in the gesture seen in the Harvard fragment. A good example is the late Antonine or Severan sarcophagus at Woburn Abbey depicting Achilles on Skyros. On the Woburn Abbey sarcophagus, the third daughter from the left assumes this pose, identifiable despite the fact that her arm has been restored without the bracelet which, in the original story, the girls grabbed while Achilles was busy with the martial equipment (McCann, 1978, pp. 67-68, fig. 73).

The figure of a standing woman is cracked on a line going across the breast, with another on a line along the right arm and across to the waist. The surfaces are worn, the modeling indistinct. Three holes are drilled in the base. The piece was reused in the Middle Ages (Guntram Koch, according to notes in object file). The back was cut down, and a mosaic with two red bands and black patterns was inserted.    The woman is fully draped and holds the himation with her right hand, in a version of the so-called pudicitia gesture, or the pose of a Muse. Her head is turned to the left.   Her position and general pose can be visualized by the lady on the left front of the large, columnar sarcophagus with portals, in Cordoba (Himmelmann, 1973, p. IX, pl. 7). On a fluted sarcophagus of the fourth century A.D., a similar lady stands in the rectangular frame of the left front, with Orpheus charming the beasts in the center panel and the husband as a philosopher in the frame on the right front corner (Pesce, 1957, pp. 102-103, no. 57, figs. 113-116, at Porto Torres, Basilica di San Gavino, in the crypt). Usually the women are on the left instead of the right front corner, unless two women are involved. Compare, for style and date, the lady in orans pose on the left front of a fragmentary strigilar sarcophagus in Bonn (Bieber, 1977, p. 251, fig. 892).   There are, of course, many illustrations of Roman sarcophagi reused in Medieval times, usually as coffins. Those brought from the Ostia necropolis to the Campo Santo at Pisa are classic examples. Sarcophagi were also used as storage chests and as fountain basins, particularly in Renaissance times when their carving was appreciated for historical and literary as well as symbolic reasons. Sarcophagi cut into slabs and carved or inlaid on the flattened interior surfaces are rather rarer. A spectacular example is in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, a section of strigilar front with an Amorino supporting an imago clipeata at the left, turned on its right end and carved with two Neapolitan, French-style, Late Gothic saints (Agnes and ?) in a setting of two arches supported in the center by a slender column (Vermeule, C., Cahn, Hadley, 1977, pp. 42-43, no. 58, and p. 68, no. 96).

The head came from a statue. The stone and the parallels with turbaned terracottas from the temple site at Arsos suggest that the head came from this area (Porphyrios Dikaios, note in object file, January 1953).   Her cloth turban is drawn tightly over the rolls of hair around the crown of her head, revealing strings of stylized curls around the forehead, and loops of hair and braids under it. The cloth falls vertically and simply, without wrinkles, down the back of the head and over the neck, like a British soldier’s or a French legionnaire’s dustcloth in the period around 1900. What remains of the face shows that she had the large, bulging eyeballs of the Daedalic heads and the hint of an Archaic smile.   Although a simpler cloth headdress is worn and the face is thinner, this head, especially in the eyes, relates to the upper part of a limestone statue in the Cyprus Museum, from Arsos (Dikaios, 1961, p. 96, pl.

The provenance of the relief in Berlin at major Imperial city in northwest Asia Minor and the relationship to the bronze group known as the Invitation to the Dance suggest the original of these two reliefs was very likely made in a Bithynian or Mysian center such as Cyzicus, where the Invitation to the Dance appears on Greek Imperial coins. Pergamon under Marcus Aurelius (Emperor A.D. 161-180) also created a masterful numismatic reverse, a satyr and the young Dionysos, based on a relief related to these examples (Vermeule, C., 1983, p. 14, fig. 23).

The nose is slightly worn. Drill holes were used for the tear ducts and pupils of the eyes and in the hair. The hair is very stylized, arranged in rows with incised lines over the surfaces.   This type of mask appeared in various forms all over the Roman Empire, at Tralles in southern Lydia (Bieber, 1961a, p. 243, fig. 801), in a mosaic by Heraclitus in the Lateran (Bieber, 1961a, p. 243, fig. 802), and, in the third century A.D., in the theater at Ostia, where Herakles and bearded heroes are represented (Bieber, 1961a, p. 244, fig. 805). Wall paintings at Pompeii even show such masks of tragedy as state props (Bieber, 1961a, p. 228, fig. 762). A relief in the Villa Torlonia-Albani in Rome shows the intellectual implications of such a mask, for it appears on a table between two poets or playwrights who are contemplating it (Reinach, 1909-1912, III, p. 150, no. 4).   A mask similar to this, from a relief or possibly a free-standing monument, is set on what appears to be a tripod. It comes from the area of the Acropolis in Athens and is in the museum there (Walter, 1923, p. 212, no. 420, fig. 7). Another mask like the Harvard example is among a set of such decorative sculptures in Copenhagen. As has been pointed out by Frederik Poulsen, they come from Roman temples as well as theaters (Poulsen, 1951, pp. 252-253, under nos. 377-381, pl. 25). Also there is an example in a set from the Villa Altieri at Rome, now in Liverpool, and termed perhaps that of a young male character (Ashmole, 1929, p. 57, no. 134, pl. 46).

The remains of the nose and the face are chipped. The condition of the back of the head suggests it may have been reused as a building block. There are drill points in the corners of the mouth, eyes, and ears.   The lady has a plump, round face with ample jowls. Her hair is plaited symmetrically in back, and has a net of incised cross-hatching. Enough of the incised pupils of the eyes survives to show that the lady, who is middle-aged or older, was glancing sideways, to her right. The ears are well modeled, and there are four incised lines in front of the earlobes.   Among the good number of portraits in marble of women that relate to this fragment, there is a lady of much thinner, longer face in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen (Poulsen, F., 1951, p. 529, no. 762, pl.

The top of the head and forehead is broken away. The face is badly abraded. Other surfaces are chipped and discolored.   The original sarcophagus portrayed the myth of Achilles on Skyros. Now the upper part of the body of Odysseus, moving to the left, survives, the head and neck of a horse visible over his left shoulder. The cloak of Diomedes can be seen to the right of Odysseus. A section of the molding survives at the top.   The ultimate provenance of this fragment, like the Amazon sarcophagus from Smyrna, is evidence of the widespread export of Attic mythological sarcophagi. The Achilles on Skyros sarcophagus fragment brought to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum at Fenway Court, Boston, in 1986 from the Renaissance gardens at Green Hill (the Gardner estate in Brookline, Massachusetts) is seemingly from an earlier presentation of the subject. This splendid fragment of Achilles and one or two of the daughters of King Lykomedes recalls that these Attic Achilles on Skyros sarcophagi went to Italy, like the great sarcophagus of ""Alexander Severus,"" as well as to the Greek East. The earlier examples usually had temple-form lids, but the later sarcophagi from Attic ateliers featured the deceased reclining on the lid as if on a couch. Achilles was hidden by his mother Thetis among the king's daughters to prevent him going to the Trojan War and certain death. Disguised as itinerant merchants, Odysseus and Diomedes placed a sword amid trinkets for the daughters. Achilles snatched up the sword and was thus revealed. The whole episode on a sarcophagus symbolizes the beginning of the Greek hero's ill-fated journey to war and death, a fate that befell many Romans, especially in the third century A.D.

This portrait conveys a strong, frontal feeling. The hair is cut short, and occasionally the details of the curls are incised. The closed mouth conveys the suggestion of a smile.   There are a number of contemporary portraits of Romans and others similar to this bearded man, varying only in the shapes of their heads and the degrees to which hair and beard are cut or incised. The one-eyed man in Schloss Erbach is slightly older in years and sat for his veristic likeness, with more incision of hair and beard, nearly a decade or more later (Fittschen, 1977, pp. 92-93, no. 35, pl. 41, dated A.D. 250). In the Depot at Aydin (ancient Tralles), the bust of an older man has a noble and forceful face, with parallel grooves in the hair and greater ""stippling"" in the beard at the face (Inan, Rosenbaum, 1966, p. 175, no. 234, pl. CXXX, figs. 1, 2). A man from Rome, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, is likewise older, more emaciated, and represented with greater incision of what stringy hair remains (Richter, 1948, no. 94). Such men are the focal figures on the large sarcophagi marking the transition from earlier Severan styles to the incised verism of the middle of the century, as a head of the A.D. 230s to 240s in Leningrad bears witness (Voshchinina, 1974, p. 191, no. 76, pl. XCVII). The younger contemporary of this man is in the National Museum, Athens, and begins to show the slight shift of the eyes sideways, as characterizes portraiture of the period from the Emperor Maximinus the Thracian through the short reign of the Emperor Traianus Decius (A.D. 235-251) (Catling, 1982, pp. 6-7, fig. 3).

The gate of Athena Archegetis, or western propylon of the Roman Agora in Athens, has the Athenian version of this capital, where, however, in the traditions of the fifth century B.C., the start of the fluted column is preserved as part of the capital (Travlos, 1971, pp. 32-33, figs. 40, 41).

There is an inscription along the front of the base.   A container of scrolls sits next to the left foot. The curled object, mostly drapery, by the right foot suggests the bottom of a serpent-entwined staff, partly covered by or ending in a section of drapery, and indicates the subject was possibly portrayed as Asclepius. The character of the footgear add evidence that this small statue portrayed a mortal rather than the god himself. Such statuettes were usually votive, as here, or funerary in nature, like the noble image of the boy L. Julius Magnus in the British Museum (Vermeule, C., von Bothmer, 1956, p. 333, pl. 110, fig. 25).   Usually it is the omphalos of Apollo that appears beside Asclepius, as in the statue of an early Antonine physician as the god, in the Braccio Nuovo of the Vatican (Bieber, 1957, pp. 74-77, fig. 8).

The woman may wear a low, curved, and uncovered headdress that is otherwise featureless, although the back of the head of the statuette is convex. Her eyes are raised circular discs, the nose is small and triangular, and upper and lower lips are clearly molded. Minute vertical lines above the eyes may indicate eyebrows. Her small, pointed chin is held slightly upward. Her neck is thick and flat, leading to sloping shoulders and a flat, triangular torso. She wears a long, form-fitting, and featureless dress with the end of the hem clearly indicated around the ankles. Her arms are held pressed against her sides, with narrow grooves on either side indicating the separation of her torso and arms. Her left arm is completely fused to her side, with the palm pressed against her left hip; shallow incisions indicate fingers. The right arm is slightly bent near the wrist, holding the palm upward; part of the hand is missing, although it was likely once holding out an offering; two small incisions indicate fingers. Below the narrow waist, the statuette becomes blocky and herm-like, particularly on the front, where the dress takes on a straight, rectangular appearance. On the back, it is slightly rounder, especially around the buttocks. The feet are a solid block with a groove on the top and between the heels to indicate their separation.   Thousands of small, anthropomorphic copper alloy statuettes and anatomical votives have been recovered from remote sanctuary sites in south-central Spain, particularly Collado de los Jardines and Castellar de Santisteban, but it is not certain to which god or gods they were dedicated (2). Many of the statuettes depict individuals, some of whom are represented in poses of prayer or offering (3). Some are very abstract and schematically rendered, while others wear identifiable contemporary clothing (4). In spite of the similarity of the votives, there is nothing to indicate that the intention behind each offering was the same. This example is most likely from the cave sanctuary of Collado de los Jardines near Santa Elena, Jaén. It was given to Harvard in 1933 by the Republic of Spain in exchange for the cover of the eleventh-century sarcophagus of Alfonso Ansúrez from Sahagún, León, which was then in the collection of the Fogg Art Museum (5).

Also missing, and smoothed off, is the end of the drapery at the left hand.  The weight at the end of the drapery above the left foot is broken off.  The surfaces, although cleaned, are generally in excellent condition.     She is standing, wearing a long chiton and an ample himation.  The garment conceals her right hand in the drapery hanging down her right side and the left hand in the folds that fall from the right shoulder to the left side, and the part of the cloak crossing from the right side to the left shoulder.  The polish suggests the early Antonine period of the Roman Empire, but the cleanness of the drillwork could put that date back in the Flavian age.   This small statue has been recognized as a reduced replica of the Demeter in VI.5 of the Galleria dei Candelabri of the Vatican (Lippold, 1956, p. 410, no. 5, pls. 174, 175).  The Vatican statue, a smaller version in the University Museum, Philadelphia, and a lifesized statue in the Torlonia Collection in Rome all have head preserved with the figures, and show a young lady with a so-called ""melon coiffure.""  The attributes preserved in part in the lowered left hands of the Vatican and Philadelphia statues included two poppy-buds and sheaves of wheat.  The youthful heads, at least one if not all of which must be ancient and pertinent, suggests the subject is Kore rather than the older, more mature Demeter.  In a well-reasoned publication of the small statue in the University Museum, Karla K. Albertson has suggested the original should date about 240-230 B.C., when Berenike II of Egypt was being represented in Ptolemaic decorative art.  Versions from full-scale to tabletop statuette were carved from late Hellenistic times onward for shrines and houses or gardens from Delos and Crete to Pompeii (Albertson, 1979, pp. 176-179, under no. 86).   As with other, popular draped statues available in Rome from Renaissance times onward, the Ceres or Demeter of the Galleria dei Candelabri was copied by Neo-Classic sculptors and decorators in various materials.  One of these statues, 1.16 m high, is the Ceres by Francois Joseph Bosio, carved about 1800 and given to the Boston Athenaeum in 1845 (this and much other information adduced by Maxwell L. Anderson).   The common characteristic of most of these statues, ancient and modern, is their varying size, most being large statuettes but including a full-scale example.  This suggests a variety of uses among the ancient sculptures, some for votive figures in small shrines or funerary portraits.  The Grenville Winthrop statue could have been a portrait, with the divine identification of the prototype removed by concealing the left hand in the cloak.     The perception that these statues and reduced versions can be vehicles for imperial portraits is strengthened by the appearance of one of the imperial mothers in this costume on the south frieze of the Ara Pacis Augustae.  She may be Julia, daughter of Augustus, following her husband, Agrippa (Bieber, 1977, p. 191, pl. 134, fig. 792).   A somewhat larger, allegedly ancient replica of this statue, specifically the Winthrop marble, was sold at auction in London as work of the first century A.D.

The noses are missing and the surfaces are worn.   The bearded head, in front of the strip of two-part molding, is turned to the right. The helmeted head of Athena or Roma-Virtus faces left, toward the man. Part of the man's shoulder seems to remain at the left, and the helmeted female figure may have been raising her arm to pat her helmet, as on the later Cancelleria relief in Rome.   The bearded man, who wears a fillet in his hair, could be a local man of letters, or he could be a representation of the Demos of Seleucia Pieria or Antioch, the latter city usually personified by her famous Tyche of Eutychides seated above the swimming river Orontes. This fragment of a figured panel with architectural molding certainly comes from a civic or commemorative rather than a funerary relief. If the bearded man were a famous private citizen rather than a god (like Asklepios) or a personification (like Boule or Demos), then the panel might have had a mixture of real people and divinities, like the Zoilos frieze at Aphrodisias in Caria or the Late Antique reliefs in the façade of the Temple of Hadrian at Ephesus.   The pair (part of a series) of limestone reliefs dedicated in A.D. 159 by a Palmyrene priest in the Temple of the Gaddé (or Fortunes) of Palmyra and Dura at Dura-Europos on the Euphrates, although Palmyrene in style, shows god, heroes, and real people in frontal poses suggestive of what the Antiochene relief-fragment must have looked like when complete (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1976, p. 48, under no. 63). It would be natural that, in the second and third centuries A.D. (save in times of military crisis), Antioch-on-the-Orontes and its port or suburbs would produce the Roman counterparts in marble to what the Palmyrenes created in their special styles in limestone.

294678,Published Catalogue Text,2016,"Drawings from the Age of Bruegel, Rubens, and Rembrandt: Highlights from the Collection of the Harvard Art Museums","Wallerant Vaillant is best known as the ﬁrst professional printmaker to specialize in mezzotint and for his technical innovations in that medium. A pioneer of the pastel portrait, he also developed a technique for drawing monochromatic likenesses in black and white chalk on blue paper, of which this work is a characteristic example. It belongs to a group of portraits of dignitaries who gathered in Frankfurt am Main in 1658 to elect a successor to Emperor Ferdinand III, who had died the previous year. In his Teutsche Academie of 1675, Joachim von Sandrart wrote that, faced with the opportunity of por-traying so many prominent individuals, Vaillant opted to depict them “life-size, in black and white on blue paper” rather than in the more time-consuming medium of oil paint. “In this way,” wrote Sandrart, “he was able to portray nearly all the high potentates who were present with astonishing speed and also with great elegance and...praiseworthy knowledge of his art.”(1)   Vaillant’s innovative technique, which enabled him to obtain a range of tonal values that lend a pictorial ﬁnish and lifelike naturalism to the portrait, depended on his skillful working of powdered colored chalks with a stump. In the Harvard portrait, he used black and white chalk and, by varying the quantity of the ﬁnely ground dry pigment distributed on the paper, modulated the values from rich, velvety blacks to luminous, light grays.(2) Within some passages of blacks and grays — for example, in the hair in the Harvard portrait — he modeled the forms by lifting out some of the black pigment with, perhaps, a clean stump or kneaded fresh bread.(3) To ﬁnish the portrait, he added strokes of white chalk to the nose, hair, edge of the collar, and decorative elements of the doublet and cross, and he used a sharpened black chalk for ﬁne detailing in the facial features, hair, and doublet. According to an eighteenth-century source, Vaillant constructed stumps “of several rolls of white paper,...roll’d up very hard and close, bigger or lesser according as his work requir’d with which he rubb’d in the several colours.”(4)   Among the portraits Vaillant executed in Frankfurt in 1658 were likenesses of the seven electors, including Johann Philipp von Schönborn, Archbishop of Mainz, who voted to elevate the Austrian archduke Leopold to the imperial throne as Emperor Leopold I.(5) That Schönborn is the subject of the Harvard portrait is conﬁrmed by the text beneath the etching Vaillant executed after either the Harvard work or the later version of it in Dresden (Figs. 1, 2).(6) The latter belongs to a second series of twelve portraits, which the Saxon elector Johann Georg II ordered from Vaillant in 1658 or 1659, depicting dignitaries who attended the Frankfurt diet.(7) A Dresden document of 1659 describes Vaillant’s original portrait of Johann Georg II as “painted gray in gray with dry colors on paper” — an afﬁrmation that his contemporaries responded to the pictorial qualities of his drawings — and reveals that it hung on the wall in an ebony wood frame.(8)  Elected prince-bishop of Würzburg in 1642 and archbishop of Mainz in 1647, Johann Philipp von Schönborn was the highest ranking prince of the Empire, its arch-chancellor, incumbent of its most prestigious ecclesiastical ofﬁce, and a politician of European stature. He skillfully wielded his considerable secular power to secure peace and restore prosperity to territories devastated during the Thirty Years’ War. In 1647–48, he led a group of moderates that maneuvered the emperor and conservative Catholics into a religious compromise with liberal Protestants, precipitating a swift conclusion to the historic Treaty of Westphalia. With his militarily weak territories sandwiched between the great powers of Austria and France, he deftly adjusted his allegiance to the two rivals during the 1650s and 1660s. In Frankfurt in the summer of 1658, Johann Philipp and the French diplomat Hugues de Lionne — the subject of another portrait by Vaillant in the museums’ collection (1986.611)—negotiated the League of the Rhine, a defensive agreement between a confederation of German princes and the French king that aimed to curtail the military ambitions of Austria.(9)    Notes   1.

Vaillant perfected the technique of reductive modeling in drawings by lifting some of the media from areas of tone before he learned about mezzotint from his patron, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, during the mid-1650s. The similarity of this process to working from dark to light in mezzotint by scraping away the highlights is obvious and must explain in part Vaillant’s facility with the medium and the rapid technical advances he made after Prince Rupert introduced him to it.   4.

William W. Robinson",NULL,"Wallerant Vaillant is best known as the ﬁrst professional printmaker to specialize in mezzotint and for his technical innovations in that medium. A pioneer of the pastel portrait, he also developed a technique for drawing monochromatic likenesses in black and white chalk on blue paper, of which this work is a characteristic example. It belongs to a group of portraits of dignitaries who gathered in Frankfurt am Main in 1658 to elect a successor to Emperor Ferdinand III, who had died the previous year. In his _Teutsche Academie_ of 1675, Joachim von Sandrart wrote that, faced with the opportunity of por-traying so many prominent individuals, Vaillant opted to depict them “life-size, in black and white on blue paper” rather than in the more time-consuming medium of oil paint. “In this way,” wrote Sandrart, “he was able to portray nearly all the high potentates who were present with astonishing speed and also with great elegance and...praiseworthy knowledge of his art.”[1]    Vaillant’s innovative technique, which enabled him to obtain a range of tonal values that lend a pictorial ﬁnish and lifelike naturalism to the portrait, depended on his skillful working of powdered colored chalks with a stump. In the Harvard portrait, he used black and white chalk and, by varying the quantity of the ﬁnely ground dry pigment distributed on the paper, modulated the values from rich, velvety blacks to luminous, light grays.[2] Within some passages of blacks and grays — for example, in the hair in the Harvard portrait — he modeled the forms by lifting out some of the black pigment with, perhaps, a clean stump or kneaded fresh bread.[3] To ﬁnish the portrait, he added strokes of white chalk to the nose, hair, edge of the collar, and decorative elements of the doublet and cross, and he used a sharpened black chalk for ﬁne detailing in the facial features, hair, and doublet. According to an eighteenth-century source, Vaillant constructed stumps “of several rolls of white paper,...roll’d up very hard and close, bigger or lesser according as his work requir’d with which he rubb’d in the several colours.”[4]   Among the portraits Vaillant executed in Frankfurt in 1658 were likenesses of the seven electors, including Johann Philipp von Schönborn, Archbishop of Mainz, who voted to elevate the Austrian archduke Leopold to the imperial throne as Emperor Leopold I.[5] That Schönborn is the subject of the Harvard portrait is conﬁrmed by the text beneath the etching Vaillant executed after either the Harvard work or the later version of it in Dresden (Figs. 1, 2).[6] The latter belongs to a second series of twelve portraits, which the Saxon elector Johann Georg II ordered from Vaillant in 1658 or 1659, depicting dignitaries who attended the Frankfurt diet.[7] A Dresden document of 1659 describes Vaillant’s original portrait of Johann Georg II as “painted gray in gray with dry colors on paper” — an afﬁrmation that his contemporaries responded to the pictorial qualities of his drawings — and reveals that it hung on the wall in an ebony wood frame.[8]  Elected prince-bishop of Würzburg in 1642 and archbishop of Mainz in 1647, Johann Philipp von Schönborn was the highest ranking prince of the Empire, its arch-chancellor, incumbent of its most prestigious ecclesiastical ofﬁce, and a politician of European stature. He skillfully wielded his considerable secular power to secure peace and restore prosperity to territories devastated during the Thirty Years’ War. In 1647–48, he led a group of moderates that maneuvered the emperor and conservative Catholics into a religious compromise with liberal Protestants, precipitating a swift conclusion to the historic Treaty of Westphalia. With his militarily weak territories sandwiched between the great powers of Austria and France, he deftly adjusted his allegiance to the two rivals during the 1650s and 1660s. In Frankfurt in the summer of 1658, Johann Philipp and the French diplomat Hugues de Lionne — the subject of another portrait by Vaillant in the muse- ums’ collection (""1986.611"":http://staging.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/294415?position=0) —negotiated the League of the Rhine, a defensive agreement between a confederation of German princes and the French king that aimed to curtail the military ambitions of Austria.[9]   William W.

I am grateful to Dr. Timothy Mayhew for the following account of Vaillant’s technique, based on his examination of the two Harvard portraits, ""1986.610"":http://staging.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/294678?position=0 and ""1986.611"":http://staging.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/294415?position=0.   fn3.  Vaillant perfected the technique of reductive modeling in drawings by lifting some of the media from areas of tone before he learned about mezzotint from his patron, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, during the mid-1650s. The similarity of this process to working from dark to light in mezzotint by scraping away the highlights is obvious and must explain in part Vaillant’s facility with the medium and the rapid technical advances he made after Prince Rupert introduced him to it.   fn4.

The trefoil mouth of the vessel is thickest along the edge, with a round central mouth and two narrower sides. The neck is a long, thin cylinder, and the body is an oblate sphere. The foot is a raised ring at the bottom. The flat handle is widest at the mouth, tapering from 5.7 cm to 0.9 cm at the bottom. The main incised design of the handle includes a series of volutes with short marks and circles. At the top of the handle, there is extensive, although faint, stippling; toward the bottom of the handle, the decoration simplifies into a row of circular marks. The sides of the top of the handle are contoured to correspond to the incised decoration on the exterior; the sides of the gripping portion of the handle are raised edges. The attachment plate is a simple circular shape. The handle is attached to the vessel by means of two rivets under the lip and one in the body; the rivets have semispherical heads visible on the interior of the vessel at the top and on the exterior at the attachment plate.   Exact parallels are lacking for this vessel, in both the shape of the body and the handle. The globular vessel body with long neck and trefoil mouth might be compared to seventh-century-BCE ceramic examples from the Phoenician world (1).   NOTES:   1. See ceramic examples in E.

It has a raised, rolled border around a molded section, which consists of plain sections framed by raised lines of varying thickness. This example is not inscribed. Two wire rings pierce the midpoint and extant corner of the upper border; an additional circular hole pierces the upper border near the midpoint.   Harvard’s Cretan armor is part of a larger cache, portions of which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg; and the Heraklion Archaeological Museum. Many of the other pieces in the group are highly decorated with incised and repousse images. The objects do not appear to have been part of a dedication to a deity, given the inscriptions found on the pieces. Fourteen pieces of armor from the cache bear dedicatory inscriptions, naming several different warriors, and these seem to indicate that the group of armor was captured in battle and dedicated together as a group (1). It has also been suggested, however, that they perhaps were used for a war dance rather than for combat (2).   The term “mitra” is known from Homeric literature as a piece of armor worn near the waist; the same word was later used to refer to a type of headwear. No contemporary depictions of warriors show how these semicircular objects were worn (3). Semicircular pieces of bronze, like this piece, are often found in caches of armor, indicating that they were part of a warrior’s panoply, but they may not in fact be ancient mitrai.   NOTES:   1.

Locks of hair emerge from under the cap to frame his face. The eyes, nose, and mouth are rendered somewhat unevenly on his broad face. He carries a curved staff in his right hand, which connects at the bottom to his right leg, and holds his left arm out, palm open. Cupid turns his head to the proper left, while his torso is frontal and bent forward slightly, and his legs are extended to the right, with the right leg down and the left leg raised and bent at the knee. The body from the torso to the legs is rendered in a particularly round, child-like way. His wings, which are extended to indicate flight, are short and curving. The details of the feathers are simple, indicated by semicircular punches and short incisions on the interior. The figure is modeled in the round, but there are very few additional details on the reverse.   In contrast to the Greek Eros, who was often depicted as a nude youth with wings, Roman Cupid generally took on the appearance of a putto, a slightly chubby young child. Cupids are depicted participating in many activities in Roman art, from music and dancing (2) to harvesting and farming (3) to fighting and playing games (4). Cupids (erotes) often appear as attendants to other deities, especially Venus (Aphrodite), and Harvard’s copper alloy Cupid statuettes may have been part of larger statuette groups (5).

301882,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This slender, muscular nude youth displays a number of features typical of Transitional-style male figures, including planar hips, featureless abdomen, high inguinal ridge, and muscular but slender body. His legs, rendered with bulging calves and prominent kneecaps, descend from high rounded buttocks. The feet are projecting tabs with no incisions to represent the toes. His weight rests on his right foot, while his left foot is drawn back slightly. His slender arms end in hands marked by thumbs, and the featureless fingers are cast as one mass. His left arm extends sideways, bent at the elbow, with palm downward. He raises his right arm to the level of his forehead, palm upward. This gesture, which resembles a greeting or a salute, may be the result of some blow or distortion of the arm after it was cast. The head, raised on a cylindrical neck, is large in proportion to the rest of the figure. The face has a prominent long nose, large oval eyes, and full lips. The hair rises as a framing border over the forehead and continues downward on both sides, covering the ears and wrapping around into a loop or curl that tucks under a fillet or diadem. The locks on the hair of the forehead band and krobylos are marked throughout by tiny vertical incisions. However, the hemispherical crown of the head has no incisions. A small round knob projects from the back at the level of the shoulders. Beneath this, a larger knob, square with rounded corners and a flat surface, extends from the small of the back. These features suggest that this youth was attached to a larger object, perhaps a tripod or large bronze vase.    Bronze statuettes with such knobs projecting from their backs in the Museo Nazionale di Reggio Calabria come from excavations at Locri in southern Italy. The rather awkward squarish modeling of this youth’s body and his disproportionately large head also suggest that he is the product of a bronze-casting workshop somewhere in Magna Graecia, perhaps Locri itself (1). The unusual coiffure recalls some representations of Apollo, founder and sanctioner of the Greek colonial foundations in Southern Italy and Sicily. The date is probably somewhere between 480 and 470 BCE.           NOTES:   1. On Greek bronzes in southern Italy, see U.

Two perforations for binding the sections of the diploma together are visible in the central, uninscribed portion of the plaque. Horizontal bends in the sheet resemble creases. The letters range from 4.5 mm high at the beginning of the text to 3 mm high in the last line. The line with the name of the recipient has letters of 5 mm high. The exterior surface of this sheet bears the full text of the diploma. The reverse, with the orientation rotated 90 degrees, bears a repetition of the beginning of the text. The missing sheet would have had the remaining text on its interior surface and a list of names on its exterior. The two sheets would have been bound together and sealed—the list of names on the second sheet would correspond to the men whose seals appeared on the diploma. If there were any suspicions that the exterior text of the document had been tampered with, the seals would be broken and the interior text checked to see if it matched the exterior. A further record was kept in Rome on a wall near the temples of Minerva and of the deified Augustus (2).   Diplomas were issued to certain groups of the Roman military, e.g., auxiliary soldiers, members of the fleet, and Praetorians at discharge (after a career of service) or after certain military campaigns (3). The language on the diplomas is formulaic, giving the titles of the emperor(s), a list of the units receiving diplomas on the specific date, the privileges granted, and the name of the individual to whom the specific diploma belonged (4). This diploma grants Lucius Domitius Firmus, a member of the 8th Praetorian cohort, the right to marry and guarantees Roman citizenship to any children resulting from that marriage. Praetorian cohorts normally served in Rome; although Lucius Domitius Firmus was originally from Caesarea Mazaca (modern Kayseri, Turkey), he might not have returned there if he survived to complete his term of service (5).

Her long dress (chiton), with elbow-length sleeves, is bordered at the bottom by two thin linear bands and by a raised, rope-like band around the collar and along the edge of the exposed sleeve. Over her dress is a mantle (himation) that drapes over her proper left shoulder. The edge of the mantle bears a raised border similar to the dress that falls in a zigzag pattern. She wears elaborate, pointed shoes (calcei repandi) with laces clearly rendered on the tops and soles on the bottoms. The figure is fully modeled in the round.   The identity of this figure is uncertain. Turan, the Etruscan goddess of love and beauty, has been suggested, but this cannot be confirmed (1).

The thighs are joined until the knees. His genitalia are only slightly indicated. His left arm is lowered to his waist and extended out; the left hand is missing. His right arm is raised and slightly bent at the elbow. Cupid looks up at his raised right hand, which holds a phiale, presumably to suggest a liquid offering. His childish face is round and framed by curls falling from the central part in his hair (1). Although the details are worn, it seems that his hair is drawn into a central plait on the back of his head, with a heavy roll of hair at the nape of his neck. Cupid’ torso is bent slightly backward, and small rounded wings sprout from his shoulder blades; the wings are featureless.   In contrast to the Greek Eros, who was often depicted as a nude youth with wings, Roman Cupid generally took on the appearance of a putto, a slightly chubby young child. Cupids are depicted participating in many activities in Roman art, from music and dancing (2) to harvesting and farming (3) to fighting and playing games (4). Cupids (erotes) often appear as attendants to other deities, especially Venus (Aphrodite), and Harvard’s copper alloy Cupid statuettes may have been part of larger statuette groups (5). Cupids are also depicted with ritual accoutrements, such as offering plates or garlands, or in ritual actions such as pouring libations and participating in animal sacrifice (6).    NOTES:   1.

A uraeus ornaments the front with its tail meandering up the crown. The legs have broken off just below the shin and have been filed down in modern times. The hands are positioned one above the other, and the shroud stands up in a ridge along the back shoulders. Faint incisions indicate a broad collar and counterpoise. The long face with faint traces of the beard attachment shows basic modeling. The staff of the crook continues down the front of the shroud midway onto the lap (1).   Osiris was one of the most popular gods of the Egyptian pantheon. Early in Egyptian history he represented a chthonic fertility god that later acquired the royal insignia of the crook and flail. He came to be identified as the ruler of the underworld. The Egyptian ruler, perceived during his lifetime as the incarnation of Horus, became Osiris after death. Over time, Osiris was equated with all deceased individuals and became a symbol of resurrection. The major cult shrine of Osiris was at Abydos in Middle Egypt, where Seti I (c. 1294-1279 BCE) built a magnificent temple in Dynasty 19.   Small bronze figurines representing Osiris show the god wrapped in a form-fitting garment, perhaps denoting a mummified shroud, and carrying the symbols of rulership—the crook and flail—in each hand. Enveloped in his shroud, Osiris’ arms are bound close to his body and his feet and legs stand together. The god is usually depicted wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt, ornamented with a uraeus (cobra) on the front and sometimes flanked by two feathers (the atef crown). In addition, this crown can rest on a set of spiraling ram’s horns that project to either side.    The bronze figurines take two basic forms: seated or standing. Within each group, several subgroups can be distinguished according to the placement of the hands. The hands can be side-by-side without overlapping, the proper right hand above the left in a vertical alignment, or crossed over one another at the wrists. G. Roeder associates the different poses to geographical areas within Egypt: those with hands side-by-side in Middle Egypt, those with hands one above the other in Lower Egypt, and those with the hands crossed over one another in Upper Egypt (2).

On the portion of the bow leading to the catchplate is a pattern of double reels and single beads. On the portion of the bow leading to the spring, following a flanged element, are three collared beads, which may also be described as alternating single reels and beads. The single reels on this arm, however, may actually be unfinished blanks. Each reel could have been worked into two smaller ones, so that the pattern would have matched that on the other arm.

The Deve Hüyük fibulae are also of large scale and bear bead-and-reel designs on their bows. Another parallel may be drawn with fibulae dated from the seventh to fifth centuries BCE attributed to the site of Ugarit on the Syrian coast (3).   Fibulae were worn at the chest or shoulder to fasten garments, similar to a safety pin. They sometimes also served to secure pendants suspended from chains (4). These devices first came into use in the Near East near the end of the second millennium BCE, when they were probably introduced by eastern Mediterranean merchants. The earliest fibulae excavated in Mesopotamia and Iran are dated to the eighth century BCE. Fibulae appear more frequently in Near Eastern contexts of the seventh century and later, when they surpassed the straight pin in popularity. Most Near Eastern fibulae have a triangular bow, as seen in the Harvard examples. Fibulae of this form, sometimes referred to as “elbow” -shaped, belong to Type XIII of Blinkenberg’s classification and to Types III and IV of Stronach’s typology (5).   Near Eastern elbow fibulae vary in size and detail, but in general, they are relatively plain and usually have bead-and-reel decoration. The arms of the bow are often of slightly unequal lengths, with the longer one terminating in a catchplate that sometimes takes the form of a human hand. The spring typically consists of a triple loop that extends into a round, tapered, and pointed pin. Fibulae were often produced from two pieces that were joined by inserting the pin into the bow.   The Harvard fibulae can be generally compared with Neo-Assyrian examples from the Mesopotamian sites of Nimrud, Nineveh, and Khorsabad, as well as with Iranian examples from Iron Age III levels at the Luristan sites of War Kabud, Sar Kabud, Cham Sul, Dam Chaft, and Tepe Nush-i Jan, among others (6). Although separate production centers probably existed, it appears Mesopotamia and Iran used similar fibula types, making it difficult to assign provenience to unexcavated pieces (7).   NOTES:   1.

The right arm and lower part of the right leg are missing. The surface is heavily corroded in some areas. The head is oblong and smooth, with no facial features or ears visible. It sits on a short neck above a long torso and rounded upper back. The left arm is slightly bent and descends to grasp the ankle of the backward bent left leg. The penis is rendered as a short protruding knob. The left leg extends forward and then bends backward at the knee to the left side. The fingers of the left hand and toes of the left foot are visible.   The chest is flat, while the abdomen is slightly rounded. The trunk is slightly inclined. The neck extends even further forward, and the raised head faces forward. The position of the thigh of the right leg suggests that the leg was extended forward and bent upward slightly, with the foot placed flat. The position of the missing right arm cannot be restored with certainty.   While the seated posture, bent torso, and leg placed in front of this figure recall the “helmet maker” type of seated figurine (1), the Harvard figurine differs in several ways. “Helmet makers” are bearded and usually belted, use their feet to secure a platform or anvil in front of them, and hold a tool in one hand and the object being worked in the other. The Harvard figurine is smooth and beltless (2) and is not engaged in any kind of craft activity. Therefore, it appears to be an unusual variant of the squatting or seated man type of statuette in the repertoire of Greek Geometric bronze statuettes.   NOTES:   1.

303652,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This large, intact spectacle fibula retains its original springiness, as with many spectacle fibulae. The tip of the pin projects 2.52 cm beyond the catchplate. The wire is square in section and varies in thickness from 0.53 cm in the middle of the fibula to 0.28 cm at the tip of the pin and the catchplate. The spiral from which the pin begins has eight turns, while the opposite spiral, from which the catchplate emerges, has nine. The wire emerges from both spirals in the center to form two identical circular loops diagonally oriented in the middle of the fibula. Since using pairs of such large spectacle fibulae on costumes might present problems for human wearers, it seems possible that such fibulae were dedicated as votive gifts in northern Greek Iron Age sanctuaries, perhaps attached to costumes presented to the deity or even placed over a deity’s images.   These fibulae (1952.15, 1952.112, and 1986.516) represent the miniature and monumental ends of the scale of this type of symmetrical fibula, which was commonly termed a “spectacle fibula.” Each was fashioned from a single thin bronze wire, square in section, which was annealed and turned in order to create the symmetrical spiral patterns and the springy elasticity needed to close them. One sharpened end of this wire, forming the pin proper, fits into the other end, which turns up to form a catchplate. Spectacle fibulae were widely distributed throughout the Balkans and northern Greece during the eighth century BCE (1). Excavations of rich burials in the Iron Age tumuli of Vergina and elsewhere have shown that these fibulae occur in pairs, placed over the shoulders of skeletons (2). They also served as dedications in sanctuaries throughout northern and central Greece and the Peloponnesus (3). Thus, they seem to have served to connect the front and back halves of garments at the shoulders of the wearers. It would be interesting to discover whether the presence of pairs of spectacle fibulae in graves is an indicator of female burials, or if both sexes wore two. They also served as dedications.

Its eyes are round, raised protrusions on the outside of its head. The underside of the head is flat. Its coiled body appears to be smooth, with no surface modeling or incision. The shallow volute formed by the coiled body brings to mind other coiled plant and mulluscan forms that occur at the bases of cast attachments for Greek bronze vessels from the Late Archaic through the Late Classical periods. On the rear of the attachment is a shallow rounded depression (1.86 cm in diameter).    While the original use of this snake remains unclear, a plausible suggestion is that it, and perhaps a symmetrical counterpart that coiled to the left instead of the right, were attached to the handles of a small bronze volute krater (1). The bodies of the huge gorgons that form the base plates for the handles of volute kraters such as the Vix Krater, sometimes divide into snake-headed legs (2). On later volute kraters, such as the Derveni Krater of the late fourth century BCE, snakes climb up the vertical edges of the volute handles, with their heads modeled fully in the round (3). The modeling of this snake suggests a date somewhere in the second half of the sixth century BCE. Closer attribution to a workshop within the greater Greek world is not currently possible.

303663,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This female statuette stands with her weight on her right leg and her left leg bent. Her right arm is bent at the elbow, with her hand on her hip and her palm facing backwards. Her left arm is also bent at the elbow, but with her forearm extended outward. With her palm up and her wrist bent slightly downward, she holds an object, which is only partially preserved and appears to have been a scroll.     The figure wears a chiton that forms a V-shaped fold below the neck. She wears a belt beneath her breasts. Over the chiton is a himation that veils the head and drapes slightly over the right shoulder, before coming around the right side of the body, sweeping diagonally upwards, and finally draping over the left arm. Few details of the himation appear on the back of the statuette. The face is considerably abraded. The figure wears a headdress from which two large feathers project.     The two feathers and the scroll suggest that the figure depicts a Muse, one of the nine Greek goddesses of literary inspiration and intellectual endeavor. The feathers refer to the Muses’ victory over the Sirens—mythical sisters with the bodies of women and the wings of birds who lured sailors into shipwrecks with their beautiful voices—in a singing contest. Although the Muses were regularly shown with feather headdresses in wall painting, on sarcophagi, and in mosaic, this Muse is one of the few surviving free-standing statuettes to include this feature (1). The rigid, standing pose of the figure and its style of drapery also resemble depictions of Muses in other media (2). The precise identity of the Muse depicted here cannot be determined, because scrolls could serve as attributes of several Muses, especially Calliope and Clio, the Muses of epic poetry and history, respectively (3). The use of bronze is also noteworthy, as most preserved three-dimensional representations of Muses are marble, while terracotta and occasionally ivory are also known. The Harvard Muse is one of the few examples in bronze surviving from antiquity.     Although neither the context nor the findspot of the statuette are known, one can speculate about its original use. Perhaps it was a decorative piece displayed in a Roman villa in the late Republican or early Imperial periods, conveying the learned qualities of the villa’s owner (4). Alternatively, the statuette might have served as a dedication in a sacred setting, such as a sanctuary or temple of the Muses, perhaps in Greece or Asia Minor. It might also have served a funerary function.     NOTES:     1.

Part of the socket has been bent inward. The edges of the two fins of the spearhead have been bent back, and there is a sizeable gap on one edge. A crack or fissure transverses the socket near the tip. The original edge of the socket has been broken away. There is a deep crack, extending up the edge of the socket toward the point. The entire spearhead has been bent into a curving shape. Its condition suggests that it was badly damaged either by use or perhaps in an attempt to melt it for reuse as scrap metal. It could also conceivably have been deliberately damaged to prevent reuse and offered as a grave gift or a dedication. The date of the object is uncertain, but it could be Late Bronze Age or as late as the Archaic period (1).   NOTES:   1. Compare M. Comstock and C. C.

There is modeled decoration on top and bottom of the hoops next to the join and on top of the joint.  The underside of the joint is concave, and no extra metal has been added, such as is seen on the top or in the other two examples (1932.56.21 and 1978.495.57).   Ringed objects with spikes are relatively common in museum collections, and most tend to come from central Italy, although some are known to have been found in France and Greece (1). They are all very similar in form, and almost all have triangular prongs. It is difficult to determine how these ringed objects were used. They have been interpreted as bow-pullers, equipment for handling the reins of horses or wagons, a type of brass-knuckle, a tool for tooth extraction, protective amulets for horses, or possibly as snaffles on horse-harnesses (2). It is currently generally agreed that they are in some way a part of early European horse equipment.     NOTES:   1. For example, see A.-M.

303674,Published Catalogue Text,1990,"Stone Sculptures: The Greek, Roman and Etruscan Collections of the Harvard University Art Museums","30  Statue of a Young God or Hero, Usually Identified as Meleager, head and torso  The arms from above the elbows and the legs at the upper thighs are missing. The head is broken at the base of the neck. Part of the nose, right ear, and right eyebrow and parts of the hair have been broken off. There is some surface chipping. Puntelli are visible on the left hip, left thigh, and left buttock. The statue was cleaned and the head rejoined in 1961—1962 by the Department of Conservation and Technical Studies at the Harvard University Art Museums.  A good number of copies of the lost original (which was probably in bronze) show a Greek hero, with a head like those of Skopas and a body influenced by the work of Lysippos, either leaning on a staff or with a spear against the left shoulder. The presence of a boar's head by the left foot and, seemingly, a hound at the subject's right side, plus the relationship to Skopas's sculptures for the temple of Tegea, have given rise to the identification of the subject as Meleager, hunter of the Calydonian boar, and the sculptor as Skopas.     While the original and its numerous, variant copies all show an ideal hero and have nothing to do with Greek portraiture, a head from a statue, now at Houghton Hall in Norfolk, was carved as a likeness of a Hellenistic ruler, surely a Seleucid. The marble was a copy of the Antonine period after an original based on Skopas's statue (Oehler, 1980, p. 73, no. 66, pl. 22).     Along with the head and torso of the statue as rejoined (most recently in 1961-1962) came eighteen fragments that may belong to the base (Hanfmann, Pedley, 1964, p. 62). Three fragments joined to form the hero's lower leg.  Another fragment is part of the thigh. Two fragments seem to have been parts of Meleager's dog and boar's head and three fragments joined to form what might have been part of the stick(?) on which Meleager leaned and part of a chlamys falling down the left arm.     The chief difference in the Harvard copy and its mate from Santa Marinella in Berlin, one of the touchstones for the group of copies, is that the javelin held in the left hand has been replaced by a staff lodged under the left arm. The feeling is that both the boar's head and the dog were part of the original composition in bronze, the latter beside the hero's right leg and the former by his left foot.   While the more slender and youthful ""boy victor"" (Narcissus) after Polykleitos could be identified as Adonis when a boar's head was added to the support on which the lad leaned, there is no question here that the more mature, more formidable figure of Meleager was intended, not the least reason being that a Meleager based on this Skopasian statue appears frequently as the protagonist on sarcophagi.

303675,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The fragment preserves a biconical bead and part of a square-sectioned pin shaft. A narrow ring molding surrounds the shaft just below the bead; further decorative details cannot be discerned due to heavy corrosion. As this object was given to the collection by one of the excavators of the Argive Heraeum, it seems likely that it was indeed found in the environs of Argos (1).   Pins of the Geometric period are well known from finds in graves and sanctuaries, especially those of female deities. They consist of a disc head with finial, a shaft that may be partly square in section and often bears incised decoration, and one or more globes or biconical beads on the upper part of the shaft. The beads may be framed by simple or multiple ring moldings. Because of its size, 1947.33.4 would have been classified as a “spit” rather than a “pin” by the excavators of the Heraeum. From a typological point of view, however, such objects are pins, albeit too large and heavy for actual use on a dress. Dedicated in sanctuaries and placed in graves, their display value as objects containing a substantial amount of metal outweighed practical considerations (2). It has even been suggested that the pins of the Geometric period may have been a primitive type of currency, like heavy rings such as 1895.202.A, 1895.202.C, 1920.44.219, and 1977.216.2123.13 (3).

The lotus flower (or waterlily), which opens in the morning and closes again at night, had powerful solar associations for the ancient Egyptians. Here Nefertem is shown wearing a pleated kilt with a tab between his legs, the left one advanced in a striding position. In his proper right hand, he carries a scimitar across one shoulder and holds his left hand clenched at his side (1). His open lotus flower crown was cast to allow inlays of an unknown substance to be set in the petals. The central spike represents the simplification of what were originally tall feathers. A small suspension loop extends from the juncture of his tripartite wig and the crown. A uraeus graces the front of the wig, while two counterpoises anchor the blossom on either side.

303679,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This thin-walled bell is hemispherical, and its walls are decorated with a floral wreath. Inside hangs a large iron clapper of square section with a pointed end, which appears too heavy for the fragile walls. It is suspended by a bronze wire that runs through a hole in its flattened top. The ends of the handle protrude through a hole in the bell’s top and then curl around the thin, bow-shaped handle. The terminals of the handle (only one is preserved) are flattened lozenge shapes and were once fastened to the bell’s top.   Thin-walled hemispherical bells are known at least from the Classical Greek period onwards (1). Unusual are the bell’s decoration, handle, and method of attaching the clapper-wire. Otherwise, thin-walled bells of hemispherical shape more frequently feature a handle consisting of a loop twisted from the same wire that also holds the clapper (2). Rare examples of the clapper-wire being tied to a handle occur on bells of different types (3). Elaborate decoration on bells is generally rare, too; representations of gods are known on Babylonian and Egyptian bells, while heroes, battles, bound enemies, and gladiators appear on Roman and Meroitic bells. Concentric circles occasionally decorate thin-walled, hemispherical Roman bells, and zigzag patterns also appear, but floral designs such as ivy leaves seem to be confined to painted Greek terracotta bells (4).   Bells (Greek: kodon; Latin: tintinnabulum) have been used by many cultures since antiquity, including in the first millennium BCE Near East and the Greek and Roman world (5). Usually made of cast copper alloy with an iron clapper, there are also examples in silver and gold (Persian, Greek, Roman, and Egyptian), iron (Roman), terracotta (Greek, Babylonian, and Egyptian), or faience (Egyptian); the latter was probably mostly symbolic rather than functional. For modern copper alloy bells, a ratio of c. 78% copper and 22% tin is considered ideal, but ancient bells usually contain less tin and more lead (6). Ancient bells functioned as signal instruments, but their sound could also have symbolic meaning. Roman bells are attested as announcing the opening of markets and baths and the spraying of streets with water; they awakened and summoned slaves, were worn by horses and other animals, functioned as apotropaic and fertility-related amulets, and played a role in Dionysiac cults especially (7).

The dome shape is not unusual and is found from early Urartian to later Roman bells, although in the Roman period it becomes rarer (1). Unique are the clapper and its method of attachment through an added “cap,” which was clearly an afterthought or quite possibly a later repair or amalgamation.

303682,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This falcon’s head, with its characteristic feathered eye and moustachial stripes, would have belonged to a larger piece, perhaps as the top to a container, part of a censor, or a bark attachment. The remnants of an attachment element extend horizontally from the back. A large sun disc and tall uraeus with trailing tail surmount a heavy wig bearing vertically incised striations. The appearance of the disc connects the bird with the sun god. The disc may display the imprint of cloth, indicating that the figure had been wrapped and buried as a votive dedication or cultically discarded.   The soaring flight and predatory character of the falcon linked the mighty raptor to the god of the living king, Horus, early in the pharaonic tradition. The living king of Egypt was identified as an earthly Horus, and from the late Predynastic Period (c. 3100 BCE), the king bore a special royal “Horus name.” The falcon, as the sacred animal of Horus, came to symbolize divine kingship, as the king was the earthly representation of Horus. The common appearance of the Double Crown and uraeus on bronze figurines of falcons reinforces this royal connection. The falcon was also associated with the sky, with its eyes representing the sun and the moon and its large wings outspread to protect the earth below. Later, the falcon became associated with the sun god Re, bearing a sun disc on its head (known as Re-Harakhty). Other gods also had falcons as their sacred animals, such as Montu the god of war, who is distinguished by a double-plume headdress.   As with so many animals associated with the divine realm, during the later periods the falcon became the focus of mummification, burial, and votive offerings. The numerous bronze falcon statuettes are characterized by their upright, yet resting, stance with wings folded at the side. They range in size from small ornaments to large, freestanding figures. Many of the larger examples, such as 1943.1118, were hollow-cast with an inner compartment in which an actual bird could be deposited. Hundreds of thousands of mummified falcons were buried in extensive catacombs at sacred sites throughout Egypt. The Greco-Roman period temples at Philae and Edfu represent the final flourishing of the cult. The more elaborately decorated figures include engraved and inlaid detailing of the feathers and facial markings. The facial patterning, seen on 1943.1118, 1957.165, and 1957.166, follows the conventions established early on with the feathered eye and moustachial stripe. Although the representation of falcons remained constant throughout Egyptian history, it is not zoologically accurate and cannot be identified with any particular species (1).   NOTES:   1.

Its upper end is concave. It was attached to a handle or shaft by two rivets, one of which is still in place. Both sides of the point are heavily corroded, and one corner of the proximal end is missing.   This triangular blade is probably for a dagger datable to the second half of the third millennium BCE. It was probably fastened to a wooden hilt, and a number of similar blades have been found in communal graves in the Messara Plain in Crete (1).    This blade was received at Harvard along with fragmentary pieces of armor datable to the seventh century BCE and said to be from Afrati, Crete (2). This blade may have been recovered with the seventh century find. Typologically, however, it is dateable to at least fifteen hundred years earlier than the Afrati armor.    NOTES:   1. K.

303706,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The belt is a thin band, widest at its center and tapering toward cast terminals, which are in the form of two beads separated by two serrated cylinders (1). The front and back surfaces are completely covered by incised decoration. The decoration on both surfaces consists of a series of nine framed zones containing representations of animals and wheels. Incised decorative elements are repeated throughout, including concentric semicircles, herringbone patterns, rows of hooks, closely spaced parallel lines, and diamond chains.    While the zones on the front and back differ both in their arrangement and in the subjects represented, they were intended to fit together into one grand composition. The front features images from the world of human affairs: two sections with domesticated horses and companion water birds in the center and a four-spoked wheel (kuklos) on either side, all separated by zones containing vertical divisions. The sequence runs in an order forming a linear ring: a-b-c-d-e-d-c-b-a. The zones on the back have a different arrangement and contain creatures from the natural world—two pairs of lions and a pair of deer in the central portion, with a pair of fish at each end—also separated by vertically banded zones. Similar to the elemental divisions seen on the double-sided catchplates of Greek bronze incised fibulae, the belt juxtaposes the sphere of untamed nature on the back with the world as shaped by human intelligence on the front, making a statement about mankind’s place in a larger cosmic order (2). Moreover, the four representational zones on the front align with the vertically banded zones on the back. As a result, all the representational zones on the front and back merge together in an integrated whole. This structural integration is a visual diagram of the way similes are integrated into the narrative structure of the Iliad.   The belt’s symbolic meaning and its integrated double-sided decorative program can be associated with an Iliad tradition that may have existed in Thessaly c. 700 BCE. In terms of the decoration, this association is both structural and thematic. The pattern and number of framed zones on the front precisely matches a plot outline of the Iliad expressed in days, four before, and four after the night embassy to visit Achilles (3). The zones on the back containing pairs of lions, deer, and fish, all subjects of similes in the Iliad, fit into the ring composition of the front, if all vertically banded zones present on the front and back of the belt are ignored (4).    The alternation of the compositional structures on the front and back interweaves specific days of narrative action represented on the front with the framed animal similes on the back, all enclosed within the bounds of Okeanos, which is represented by the pairs of fish. This integration closely mirrors compositional techniques of epic poetry, in which similes from the natural world are integrated into the ring-composition of the narrative, outlined as a paratactic chronology, or time signature (5). The belt’s decorative syntax represents several key structural characteristics of epic poetry in a visual way, such as parataxis, similarity contrasted with antithesis, hysteron proteron, and ring composition (6). The unified schema of the incised decoration represents a worldview, or cosmography, of balanced opposites. In the design, culture is opposed to nature, society to wilderness, reason to instinct, and order to chaos.    Pairing of opposites is a fundamental feature of early Greek thought, expressed in both epic poetry and in art of the Geometric Period (7). A similar interest in balanced opposition is seen in the symbolic meanings assigned to waist belts in the Iliad and Odyssey (8). Similarities between descriptions of warriors’ belts in Homeric poetry and excavated Phrygian belts suggest that these belts inspired Ionian epic singers to weave them into their songs (9). In the epic poems, a man’s zoster (heroic warrior’s belt) symbolizes kingship, war prowess, guest-friendship, and military and ethnic affiliations. On the other hand, Homeric poetry invests a woman’s belt, or zone, with notions of domesticity, passivity, chastity, and purity, clearly distinguishing gender-appropriate ideals as contrasting polarities. These ideals persist on belted figures in Greek art of the eighth and seventh centuries BCE (10). Around the middle of the seventh century BCE, the Homeric ideal of the belted hero begins to be replaced by the cooperative ethos of the hoplite, as the bell-corslet supersedes the zoster, as seen by changes in the belts dedicated at Olympia (11). Significant numbers of belt dedications at Olympia dating from the second half of the ninth century to the middle of the seventh century BCE demonstrate the value of belts as votive dedications in early Greece (12).   NOTES:   1. The form of the belt resembles smaller armbands with incised decoration found in Boeotia and Thessaly; see M. Bennett, Belted Heroes and Bound Women: The Myth of the Homeric Warrior-King (Lanham, 1997) 14 nn.10-12.    2. Similar cosmological divisions are seen on other incised fibulae at Harvard, such as 1965.27, 1985.35, 1986.580, 1986.581, 1986.582, 1986.583, 1986.588, 1986.655, and perhaps 1986.589. See M.

303711,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This solidly built zebu is portrayed with a slightly greater degree of detail than 1969.177.24. Viewed frontally, its central hump rises up behind the head, framed by the inwardly curving arc of the round, pointed horns. In profile, the hump appears almost wing-like, extending high above the body and curving slightly backwards. The head is roughly triangular in form, terminating in a blunt muzzle with a horizontal striation to mark the mouth. No eyes are indicated, but small ears protrude from the sides of the head just beneath the horns. A dewlap, hanging from the throat, creates a diagonal profile. Through the body runs a small hole, just large enough for wire to pass through. Male genitalia are represented on the underside, prominently visible in profile. The rump and hindquarters are portrayed as extending unnaturally beyond the top and sides of the body. A short tail, outlined by a groove, is depicted in relief.   This horned and humped quadruped figure, along with 1969.177.24, represents a mature zebu, a domesticated species of Asiatic cattle (Bovis indicus) that can reach up to 10 feet in height. Zebus, used primarily as draft animals, are known for their resistance to heat, pestilence, and insects. Commonly used in Africa and the Asian monsoon belt, they are ideally suited to the Caspian region of Iran, which, situated between the Elburz Mountains and the sea, is a fertile lowland whose warm, sultry climate supports yearlong cultivation.   Copper alloy zebu figurines and pendants have been excavated from graves dated to the late second to early first millennia BCE at the site of Marlik in northwest Iran, which is just south of the Caspian Sea (1). Of all the types of animal figurines found at this site, zebus are most numerously represented. Some were found in pairs in association with model plows, alluding to their use as draft animals. A number of large hollow ceramic “vessels” in the form of zebus were also found in the graves. If these vessels are interpreted as ritual objects, they suggest zebus may have had some sacred association.   The motivations for depositing these figurines in graves and their possible symbolic meaning can only be inferred. The exaggeration of potent features such as the horns, hump, and genitalia may refer to power and strength. Some ceramic figurines of rams and stags are also given a hump, revealing the fascination with, if not the culturally significant value, of this feature. Zebus’ heartiness in harsh environmental conditions and their clear association with agriculture may suggest that they are linked to notions of earthly fecundity.   In addition to finds at the site of Marlik, comparable collections of zebu figurines and pendants have reportedly been retrieved throughout the western Caspian region of Iran, Russia, and Azerbaijan (2). An apparently shared tradition of iconography may point to a more or less cohesive cultural zone based on a shared environment in which zebus played a prominent role.   NOTES:   1. See E. O.

Although corroded, traces of fine modeling along the sides of the wings and tail feathers are apparent, but no facial markings are visible. The attachment peg, which extends directly from the feet, would probably have been longer originally, and the piece may have served as a finial. This small angular falcon wears no headdress; its large feet stand on a thin rectangular base. Randomly positioned circular indentations indicate the feathers on the wings and head.   The soaring flight and predatory character of the falcon linked the mighty raptor to the god of the living king, Horus, early in the pharaonic tradition. The living king of Egypt was identified as an earthly Horus, and from the late Predynastic Period (c. 3100 BCE), the king bore a special royal “Horus name.” The falcon, as the sacred animal of Horus, came to symbolize divine kingship, as the king was the earthly representation of Horus. The common appearance of the Double Crown and uraeus on bronze figurines of falcons reinforces this royal connection. The falcon was also associated with the sky, with its eyes representing the sun and the moon and its large wings outspread to protect the earth below. Later, the falcon became associated with the sun god Re, bearing a sun disc on its head (known as Re-Harakhty). Other gods also had falcons as their sacred animals, such as Montu the god of war, who is distinguished by a double-plume headdress.   As with so many animals associated with the divine realm, during the later periods the falcon became the focus of mummification, burial, and votive offerings. The numerous bronze falcon statuettes are characterized by their upright, yet resting, stance with wings folded at the side. They range in size from small ornaments to large, freestanding figures. Many of the larger examples, such as 1943.1118, were hollow-cast with an inner compartment in which an actual bird could be deposited. Hundreds of thousands of mummified falcons were buried in extensive catacombs at sacred sites throughout Egypt. The Greco-Roman period temples at Philae and Edfu represent the final flourishing of the cult. The more elaborately decorated figures include engraved and inlaid detailing of the feathers and facial markings. The facial patterning, seen on 1943.1118, 1957.165, and 1957.166, follows the conventions established early on with the feathered eye and moustachial stripe. Although the representation of falcons remained constant throughout Egyptian history, it is not zoologically accurate and cannot be identified with any particular species (1).   NOTES:   1.

They are all very similar in form, and almost all have triangular prongs. It is difficult to determine how these ringed objects were used. They have been interpreted as bow-pullers, equipment for handling the reins of horses or wagons, a type of brass-knuckle, a tool for tooth extraction, protective amulets for horses, or possibly as snaffles on horse-harnesses (2). It is currently generally agreed that they are in some way a part of early European horse equipment.     NOTES:   1. For example, see A.-M.

His right arm was upraised, holding a club behind his head; the arm has been broken off. His left arm, missing its hand, is held out from the shoulder with a stylized lion skin draped over it. Fingers and toes are only slightly indicated. The musculature of the body is more modeled and naturalistic than other Herakles statuettes in Harvard’s collection, such as 1920.44.100, 2002.60.40, and 2012.1.9. Nipples and navel are indicated by small circular punches of the same size. Herakles’ face is very angular and stylized, with triangular eyes, lacking molded lids, and pupils incised by dots. His nose is pointed, and there are simple molded lines for lips. The head is uncovered—a diadem encircles the head. Wavy hair is indicated by lines; it is particularly long in the back and around the face. A small section of hair or perhaps a fillet sticks out over the brow.   Statuettes showing Herakles in an attacking stance like this are very common in the ancient world (1). The god may have had a connection with cultivation in early Italy (2).   NOTES:   1. See A.

303747,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The bell has four sides, rising from an almost square bulging base towards a wide domed top, in a smooth gradually curving, bulging shape. The ring handle is angular with rounded edges on the outside. Remains of a loop intended to hold the now-lost clapper are preserved on the bell’s interior. Four semi-circular projections at the base serve as feet.    Square-based bells, usually with an angular loop-handle, were common over a long period of time and in many variations throughout the Roman Empire, probably going back to the Hellenistic period (1).   Bells (Greek: kodon; Latin: tintinnabulum) have been used by many cultures since antiquity, including in the first millennium BCE Near East and the Greek and Roman world (2). Usually made of cast copper alloy with an iron clapper, there are also examples in silver and gold (Persian, Greek, Roman, and Egyptian), iron (Roman), terracotta (Greek, Babylonian, and Egyptian), or faience (Egyptian); the latter was probably mostly symbolic rather than functional. For modern copper alloy bells, a ratio of c. 78% copper and 22% tin is considered ideal, but ancient bells usually contain less tin and more lead (3). Ancient bells functioned as signal instruments, but their sound could also have symbolic meaning. Roman bells are attested as announcing the opening of markets and baths and the spraying of streets with water; they awakened and summoned slaves, were worn by horses and other animals, functioned as apotropaic and fertility-related amulets, and played a role in Dionysiac cults especially (4).

The smaller pendant (1950.138) has a rounded tail and thin legs with feet bending forward. Its head bends downward and is marked by low pellet-shaped eyes. The larger, more abstract bird’s neck and body meet almost at ninety degrees (1960.480). The body thins out into a flattened tail, whose tip is missing. Its legs are simply small stubs, the tips of which are bent forward. Its long neck intersects a pointed head at a ninety-degree angle. One small pellet eye is visible at the back of the right side of the head. Both birds have loops projecting from the middle of their backs. 1950.138 has a perforation in the middle of a projection, and 1960.480 features an oval loop with an oval perforation rising from a tab-like projection.    Both birds are designed in such a way that they balance evenly when suspended. They and many other similar examples, which appear to have included a variety of fowl, both wild and domesticated, may have been hung from the branches of trees as votive gifts in outdoor sanctuaries. They might somehow be related to Artemis, nurturer and protector of the flocks of water birds that throng the rivers, lakes, and marshes of northern Greece.   Recent laboratory examination in the Straus Center has revealed that this pendant has an artificial patina that is green with orange and brown areas and is soluble in acetone. This suggests either that this pendant is a recent forgery, or that it is an ancient object that has been stripped and repatinated.         NOTES:   1. See I.

The narrow, flat body bends gracefully at the knees and waist to assume an enthroned position. A stump on the underside of the figure may be the remains of a peg for attachment to a seat (1). The symmetrically arranged arms are bent at the elbow and extend out from the body; the hands have broken away. The attenuated body reveals no detailing. A triangular cutout below the knees separates the legs, which terminate in short, rounded feet. In contrast to the flat unornamented body, the large oval head rises on a long neck and displays subtly modeled facial features. Semicircular ears jut out from the sides of the head, which merges directly into a short pointed conical headdress.    Seated figurines constitute a well-defined group for the Levantine and northern Syrian regions during the second millennium BCE. When depicted with a tall crown, they are generally interpreted as deities. Many of them hold their right hand palms outward in benediction and their left hands in a fist. Others hold a vessel in one or both hands. Stylistically, these seated figures have as broad a stylistic range as those figurines in the smiting position (for example, 1992.256.80), from extreme Egyptianizing to those displaying more Hittite influences (2). The pointed crown and lack of Egyptianizing elements locate the manufacture of this figure further north and inland. A closely comparable piece is assigned by O. Negbi to a Syro-Anatolian group of bronzes dating to the second half of the second millennium BCE (3). An excavated example from Megiddo and a close parallel from Kamid el-Loz retain gold and silver foil covering the figures, a common practice that may account for the unfinished-looking body of the Harvard piece (4).

303777,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The vertical loop handle has a slightly tapered hexagonal grip and two anthropomorphic terminals. The upper terminal, which attached to the rim of a trefoil oinochoe, is in the form of a female head with finely engraved hair pulled back from her face and eyes positioned to look out over the vessel’s opening opposite the spout. The head has been identified as that of a goddess but it is more likely a representation of a maenad, one of the female followers of the god Dionysos (1). The lower terminal is offset from the hexagonal grip by a decorative molding that consists of a rounded element with vertical striations framed above and below by a narrow row of beads. The lower terminal depicts a frontal mask of Dionysos with a massive beard and long wavy hair bound by a diadem.    The handle is broken clear through the lower hexagonal grip and has been repaired. There is a small loss to the hair of the Dionysos mask on the proper right side. The metal has a brown patina with dark green corrosion visible in places.    NOTES:   1. The identification as a goddess is made in the Sotheby’s sale catalogue where the handle is also dated to the fifth or fourth century BCE.   2. Metal vessel handles with figural terminals have a long history in Greek art. Dionysiac imagery was particularly popular on oinochoai appropriately relating the wine jug with the god of wine. An earlier example of this type in bronze and dated to the middle of the fourth century BCE is known from a tomb at Michalitsi in Epirus. See T. Weber, Bronzekannen: Studien zu ausgewählten archaischen und klassischen Oinochoenformen aus Metall in Griechenland und Etrurien (Frankfurt am Main, 1983) 347, no. II.E.7. Outstanding examples of the middle of the fourth century BCE are the two silver oinochoai from the main chamber of Tomb II at Vergina. See M. Andronicos, Vergina: The Royal Tombs (Athens, 1993) 150-53, figs. 115-16; D. Pandermalis, Alexander the Great: Treasures from an Epic Era of Hellenism (New York, 2004) 74. The Vergina jugs have terminals framed by narrow rows of beads at the base of the handle that are very similar to the Harvard handle but more carefully rendered. Pandermalis identifies this decorative molding as a ring with an astragal. The appearance of this distinctive decorative feature on the Harvard handle may be indicative of a Macedonian workshop.

A fold hanging below this hand is delicately undercut. Unusual for Early Classical female bronze statuettes, her himation is modeled in large, heavy rounded diagonal folds, which resemble the massive treatment of drapery worn by figures on the pediments of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. The subtle, scallop-like indentations along the raised vertical fold that extends downward along the entire left side of the figure clearly represents a hem and is meant to represent a fringe on the edge of the cloth. A pronounced V-shaped groove separates this edge from the fold immediately behind it. Her left foot, with toes incised, projects from beneath her lower hem. An indication of her right foot is visible under the drapery. The figure turns her head toward her right hand, which grasps a dove. The fingers of her right hand are individually modeled. Incisions mark the wings and tail of the dove; its beak is missing. The woman’s small head is delicately modeled with carefully rendered eyes, nose, and mouth that nonetheless produce a severe expression. Large ears protrude from beneath prominent waves of hair that lead backward from the forehead. The upper section of the coiffure, rendered in waves subdivided into carefully modeled individual locks, ends in a longer curl that has been tucked under the side waves.    Her identity as Aphrodite seems clear from her exposed right breast and the dove in her right hand. As G. M. A. Hanfmann pointed out, this unusual depiction of Aphrodite suggests the potential wrath of this powerful goddess if she is spurned or offended. Hanfmann also noted the close resemblance of the head and coiffure of this statue in profile to an Early Classical marble head in Budapest (1). He was surely right in attributing her to a Peloponnesian workshop, perhaps at Argos, dating her to around 460 to 450 BCE (2).   NOTES:   1. G. M. A.

303781,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This plump bronze bird may be a goose, judging from its long, curving neck and heavy body. Its surface is a shiny blackish brown with some dark green patches. The metal is rough on the interior surfaces of both legs, and there are three tiny holes: one behind the left leg and two others beneath the body to the rear of the legs. Incised parallel lines mark the leg joints, the backside of the upper neck, and the point where the tail narrows as it rises from the back. The squared-off end of the tail is marked with twelve short parallel lines. Incised cross-hatching is visible on the breast and on the sides of the body above the legs.   The head has an elongated bill, which curves upward at the tip, and relief pellet eyes; the right eye is placed slightly farther back than the left eye. The sinuous neck flows into a curving breast and broad horizontal back. The flat, wide legs, with their spur-like joints, are bowed and terminate in forward-projecting feet on which the bird is able to stand easily. A sturdy, transverse loop rises from the back.   This bird may have been produced in a Thessalian or possibly Macedonian workshop of the late eighth century BCE. A close parallel to this piece is in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore (1). Similar birds in the Volos Museum come from Pherai, Thessaly (2). In the case of another large hollow-cast bronze bird with fanciful crest and tail, the ceramic core shifted during casting, creating a gap through which the core is visible. Presumably, the Harvard bird contains a similar ceramic core (3).   NOTES:   1. D. K.

The two long, curly locks that fall to each bare shoulder were added in wax to the wax model for the head. The facial features are blurred except for the sharp nose. The pitted surface shows this to be a porous casting, with a variety of unrepaired flaws. Abrasions of the corroded surface show bright base metal, which is in good condition. The irregular and apparently broken lower edge is a cast edge, and what might appear to be breaks in the long locks are in fact casting flaws.   The head and torso are part of a single casting, a method of production that would have been unusual in antiquity; even a small-scale work like this would more likely have had the head cast separately. It is likely that the casting was deliberately flawed or left incomplete as part of the production process, suggesting that it was produced in modern times with the intention that it should appear to be ancient.

303819,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Small statuettes of cats such as this are known to have been placed in the linen bandages of mummified cats (1). Its features are indistinct due to its small scale and corrosion, but its feline character is apparent in its erect posture. The figure also lacks part of its tail. A thin rectangular base along the bottom edge preserves the traces of an attachment tenon running from front to back.   The seated cat was the most popular animal depicted in bronze during the first millennium BCE and accompanied the increasingly widespread recognition of sacred animal cults from the Late Period through the Ptolemaic (664-30 BCE) (2). The house cat, as the domesticated counterpart to the wild feline, especially the lion, appears in Egyptian art at least as early as the Middle Kingdom (c. 2134-1665 BCE). The male, or tomcat, was associated with the sun god, and in the New Kingdom (c. 1571-1076 BCE) played an important role in the Book of the Dead as the slayer of the Apophis serpent, enemy of the sun god. In all likelihood, however, the bronze statuettes represent the female cat and are connected with a series of goddesses, in particular Bastet.   Bastet was an ancient goddess, known from at least the beginning of the Old Kingdom (c. 2687-2191 BCE). She and several other goddesses associated with the solar element were represented as feline-headed. Over time, she acquired the more benevolent characteristics of the domesticated cat, known for its fertility and nocturnal sex life, in opposition to the more threatening leonine aspects assumed by the goddess Sekhmet. In this role, Bastet and, by extension, cats were seen to be peaceful and protective. While there were other goddesses who manifested themselves as cats, for example Pakhet (“She Who Scratches”) in Middle Egypt, Bastet’s supremacy rose during the first millennium, probably as a direct result of her connection to the rulers of Dynasty 22 (c. 931-725 BCE) who came from Bubastis, the ancient cult center of Bastet.    Bubastis (modern Tell Basta near Zagazig in the eastern Delta), in addition to other Egyptian sites, became the site of a large cat cemetery at the temple of Bastet, in which mummified cats were deposited as votives. Skeletal evidence suggests that the mummified cats had been intentionally killed while still young, rather than having been cherished pets that died of natural causes (3). Small cat figurines were often wrapped in the linen bandages of the mummified remains, which were in turn placed in bronze or wooden containers in the shape of seated cats. Many of the larger, hollow-cast bronze cats can be interpreted in this way and retain an opening into the body cavity. The majority of the bronzes, however, were dedicated in shrines.   The dedication of cat mummies and votive statues has been connected to a highly institutionalized cult of the king, which may explain the large number and standardized iconography of the bronzes (4). Although there is a wide variety of types preserved, most of the bronzes achieve an anatomical correctness and express the essence of cats—haughty dignity and aloofness. They assume the seated position with head held erect and tail curled along the right side as in the hieroglyphic sign. One or both of the ears tend to be pierced, and gold hoop earrings remain on some examples. The frequent presence of a scarab beetle placed on the forehead and a pectoral on the chest suggests the protective function and solar connection of such figures.   NOTES:   1. G.

It joined the ranks of sacred animals in the second millennium BCE and was associated with the spirits of the netherworld. Like the cat, falcon, ibis, and other sacred animals, the ichneumon became the focus of cult activity in the later periods, especially the Ptolemaic (332-30 BCE). Inscriptions on bronze statues connect the weasel-like creature to the cults of Horus at Letopolis and Wadjet (Uto) at Buto, both in the Delta region, as well as to the god Atum (1). Despite its small scale, the Harvard ichneumon conveys the slinking motion of the animal through its long, pointed snout, arching back and extended tail, which is supported by a strut (2).

He appears to be nude except for a winged cap (petasus), of which one of the wings is broken, and a cloak (chlamys) over his left arm. Mercury turns his head forward and slightly down. Short locks of wavy hair are visible below the cap. His facial features are difficult to distinguish due to the condition of the surface. He reclines on his left side; his right hand rests on his hip, and his right leg is slightly raised with feet crossed at the ankles.

These heavy rings cannot be explained as finger rings or bracelets, nor do the find contexts suggest other practical functions. When found in burial contexts, they do not form part of the adornment of the dead. Like the oversized dress pins of the Geometric period (compare 1947.33.4), the rings appear to have been deposited in sanctuaries and graves for their metal value. It has been suggested that they constituted a pre-monetary form of currency (1). The rings in the Harvard collection do not confirm the standardized ratio of diameter to weight assumed in the relevant study. As their findspots are not known, it cannot be excluded that the one or the other was in fact a ring handle or part of a buckle. Some credibility may be given to their reported provenance from the Argive Heraeum, since three out of the four rings were presented to the museum by family members of one of the Heraeum excavators (2).

303839,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This large, beautifully cast, and richly detailed falcon wears the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. The royal uraeus fronts the Red Crown, while a small hole at the front of the White Crown indicates the position of the spiral, now lost and which would have been a separate piece. Around the neck hangs an engraved depiction of an amulet with two tear-shaped pendants suspended from it. Engraving also details the elaborately patterned feathers and typical facial markings. Thin gold foil surrounds the slightly raised eyes. The thick heavy ridges of the legs contrast with the delicacy of the feathering, uniting the power and majesty of the falcon. The feet were cast separately and then attached to the rest of the body. The intricacy of the original wax model is evident in the powerfully curved talons that leave open spaces between the feet and the thick base. X-radiographs reveal a compartment in the belly, in which small, hollow bones, probably of a falcon, were deposited. The rectangular opening into the cavity remains sealed with a bronze plate (1).    The soaring flight and predatory character of the falcon linked the mighty raptor to the god of the living king, Horus, early in the pharaonic tradition. The living king of Egypt was identified as an earthly Horus, and from the late Predynastic Period (c. 3100 BCE), the king bore a special royal “Horus name.” The falcon, as the sacred animal of Horus, came to symbolize divine kingship, as the king was the earthly representation of Horus. The common appearance of the Double Crown and uraeus on bronze figurines of falcons reinforces this royal connection. The falcon was also associated with the sky, with its eyes representing the sun and the moon and its large wings outspread to protect the earth below. Later, the falcon became associated with the sun god Re, bearing a sun disc on its head (known as Re-Harakhty). Other gods also had falcons as their sacred animals, such as Montu the god of war, who is distinguished by a double-plume headdress.   As with so many animals associated with the divine realm, during the later periods the falcon became the focus of mummification, burial, and votive offerings. The numerous bronze falcon statuettes are characterized by their upright, yet resting, stance with wings folded at the side. They range in size from small ornaments to large, freestanding figures. Many of the larger examples, such as 1943.1118, were hollow-cast with an inner compartment in which an actual bird could be deposited. Hundreds of thousands of mummified falcons were buried in extensive catacombs at sacred sites throughout Egypt. The Greco-Roman period temples at Philae and Edfu represent the final flourishing of the cult. The more elaborately decorated figures include engraved and inlaid detailing of the feathers and facial markings. The facial patterning, seen on 1943.1118, 1957.165, and 1957.166, follows the conventions established early on with the feathered eye and moustachial stripe. Although the representation of falcons remained constant throughout Egyptian history, it is not zoologically accurate and cannot be identified with any particular species (2).   NOTES:   1.

The body is modeled in the round with some attention given to musculature, particularly in the lower legs. He wears a knee-length kilt that extends slightly longer in the back than the front; the vertical fringed edge of the kilt is indicated by simple hatched marks along the proper left thigh. With the left foot advancing forward, the figurine stands securely on an irregularly shaped trapezoidal plate. A large looped peg extends below the base (1). Long grooves from the top of the cap, between the shoulder blades, and along the upper arms and right side indicate that metal leaf originally covered the figure. The large head sits on a long neck and tilts slightly to the proper right. An angular nose, excised eye sockets, and semicircular ears distinguish the face. Both arms extend out in front of the body and bend slightly at the elbow. The left hand holds a goblet-shaped vessel, while the right arm, missing its hand, is raised marginally higher. It was perhaps held in a gesture of benediction that is often seen in bronzes of this period, where the right hand is held open with palm outward. This gesture is more common in seated figures, but also can be found in standing and striding figures (2).    A stylistic comparison may be made with a seated bronze figure, identified by O. Negbi as a female, which holds a bowl in her right hand (3). Classified as part of a Syro-Lebanese group dating to the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries BCE, this piece displays a similar facial profile in which the juncture between the conical headdress and the forehead is marked by a carefully incised line (4). The presence of torcs may suggest a date earlier in the second millennium when torcs appear archaeologically as well as in representations (5).    NOTES:   1. G. M. A. Hanfmann and P.

The cheek pieces are highly stylized, each depicting a large horse carrying a smaller horse on its back. The large horse has a broad, flat face, with the eyes rendered as small protuberances on either side of the head, and the mouth is represented as slightly open. The ears are high pointed triangles, separated from the head. The mane is a high curving crest, perhaps reminiscent of the helmet crests of Italic warriors (1). An angled bar juts out from the bottom of the mane to connect to the body at slightly less than a right angle. The body is a long bar, with a central circular opening for the bridle bit rods to pass through. It widens slightly at the rump; the tail is a thin curving bar connected to the back hooves. The forelegs and hind legs are rendered together in two bars tapering down to the hooves, which are circles. An elaborate, curving bar connects the front and back hooves, rising up in the center where another thin bar connects it to the central ring in the body of the large horse. Two small, stylized animals appear facing each other on the bottom bar. The small horse (4.2 cm long) that is standing on the larger horse resembles the larger animal in most respects, except that it has fewer details, a proportionately shorter body, and larger rump. It is attached to the larger horse via a vertical bar from the muzzle to the central ring, the fore hooves, hind hooves, and tail.   F.-W. von Hase ascribes this piece to the second variant of his Volterra type (2), dated to the Early Iron Age. Many examples of horse-shaped cheek pieces and bridle bits include decorative pendants, attached to the various loops on the lower bar, which do not appear here. Horses were prestige animals, and elements of their tack could be quite elaborate (3).

The upper portion is missing. What remains consists of the flattened lower section of the handle in profile, convex on both sides, and the baseplate, which consists of two reclining rams facing outward above two opposed volutes in low relief. The lower part of the base attachment plate, which probably consisted of a large palmette, is missing. While the bodies of the rams are cast in low relief, their heads, facing forward and down, are rendered in the round. Their facial features are carefully rendered with horns, and there is incised cross-hatching atop their heads in front of their horns.    The handle itself rises from an oval, conical projection in high relief, the top of which is marked by a low horizontal band of tiny relief beads. Lines of similar beads mark the edges of the handle and its midsection (1). The curving reverse side of the base attachment plate reveals a centrally placed cavity that may indicate that there was once a rivet at this spot. The style of the handle and nature of the curving concavity on the backside suggest that this handle probably belonged to an oinochoe rather than a hydria.

The attachment may have served as part of a spigot for a water pipe or as a fountain fixture. Bronze spigots in the form of Ethiopians heads are known from Pompeii, where they were attached to caldaria or portable water heaters (1).   NOTES:   1. See C. A.

303850,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"On this parabolic relief plaque the goddess Cybele is depicted frontally with her hands cupping her breasts. The relief is thinnest at the edges and thickest at the center, near the goddess’s hands. Cybele is veiled, and her headdress is decorated with six griffin protomes. Her hair, visible beneath the veil, is pulled up from her face, and three long and tightly coiled locks fall on either shoulder. She wears a mantle over a peplos and a bracelet on each wrist. Three to four digits on each hand are depicted. A raised linear border encircles the plaque. There is a band with alternating rosettes and lotuses on the bottom. The main campus is bordered on the bottom side by a raised bar and around the curved area by an egg-and-dart pattern. On the upper portion of the back is an incuse or incised circle. Within the circle is a nude female, torso turned frontally and legs to the right in profile, riding a horned animal, perhaps a goat, to the left, rendered in incuse.   Given the plaque’s thickness, M. Y. Treister considered it to have been a matrix, over which thin metal would have been hammered to take the shape of the relief (1). The embossed plaque that was created could be used as a votive or for decoration. A thin parabolic silver sheet with a similar depiction of the goddess, wearing a modius (calythos) but within a parabola and holding her breasts, from the Kerameikos Museum, Athens, inv. no. M 362, could have been made on a matrix like this one (2), as could have a gold repoussé fragment in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, inv. no. AO 2066  (3). A rectangular bronze matrix in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, inv. no. 20.2.24, bears several scenes related to Cybele in intaglio on both sides, some divided into discrete units by architectural elements or geometric borders. One of these scenes is a depiction of a bust and torso of Cybele, hands cupping her breasts, within a parabolic border that is very similar to the Athens and Paris examples and iconographically related to the Harvard plaque (4). H. Seyrig compares the Louvre example with a more elaborate plaque in plaster of similar form depicting the goddess making the same gesture in Cairo (5). Plaques like the Harvard, New York, and Cairo examples could have been used as matrixes or models in the creation of the thin repoussé appliques for decorative or votive purposes (6).    NOTES:   1.

The ridges along the beak are pronounced and sharply defined as are the striated modeling on the sides of the head. The eyes were not designed to hold inlays. The tip of the beak is broken.   The Sacred Ibis bird derives its modern name from its ancient associations with the cult of Thoth, the moon god. Thoth regulated time and embodied wisdom, hence his connection with scribes, who identified him as the inventor of writing. As a manifestation of Thoth, the ibis participated in the growing prevalence of animal cults in the Late and Ptolemaic periods. The main cultic centers of Thoth were located at Saqqara, Abydos, Kom Ombo, and Tuna el-Gebel (ancient Hermopolis) where extensive catacombs of mummified ibises developed. The cultic site at Saqqara has revealed over 1.5 million mummies, and over 4 million come from the Tuna-el-Gebel catacombs (1). The birds used in these rites may have been raised by the temples specifically for this purpose. Most were buried in jars, some in ibis-shaped coffins. The two Harvard examples represent only the head, and both display tangs for attachment to the body cavities of ibis coffins. In addition to the mummified specimens, sculptural representations served as votives, examples of which have been excavated at Saqqara, Abydos, and Tuna el-Gebel (2).   Still present in Egypt in relatively large numbers until the 19th century, the Sacred Ibis’ distinctive posture and coloring lent itself to representation in a variety of media. With their long curving beaks and graceful legs, ibises appear in painted scenes of papyrus marshes or are represented sculpturally in a seated pose with legs bent underneath their bodies. A dominant characteristic—the two-tone coloring that contrasts dark beak, head, neck, legs, and wing tips with white body—was translated by the ancient artists into mixed media, most often bronze head, legs and tail affixed to a white-painted wooden body. More elaborate versions included gold, silver, and semi-precious stone inlays (3).    NOTES:   1. P. F.

The pieces were traded by weight and were sometimes broken into smaller pieces to facilitate the transactions (1). The weights of some of these pieces, however, are much higher than is usual for aes rude (2), which may argue against that use. Additionally, several of these objects have highly unusual compositions, such as copper-iron alloy and leaded copper-antimony-arsenic alloy (3). The lack of consistency in the alloy would be problematic for using these pieces for monetary exchange based on weight, because their values would vary according to the alloy. Irregular copper alloy pieces of this type often appear in votive contexts (4).   NOTES:   1. See J. G.

It is unclear how the coiling was achieved. Each bracelet was presumably cast in a single long rod and then bent into coils by annealing. The coils are flat on the interior, with a triangular ridge in the center of the exterior. The terminals consist of a biconical bead, from which extends a short grooved cylindrical element that terminates in a conical projection. The bracelets are heavily corroded, with some sections missing along the edges. 1920.44.220 is missing one terminal. There is a repair, presumably ancient, where a break has been fixed by overlapping two edges.

The bird is undecorated with the exception of three faint incised rings visible around the lower portion of the neck. Although the bird’s head is featureless and the tip of its beak is broken off, its plump body and squared-off tail suggest that this is a water bird, perhaps a duck. The bird’s legs merge into a short, four-sided post that tilts slightly forward and has a transverse hole at its upper end. The post terminates in a round base whose upper side is plain, while its underside bears a cross within a circle in high relief that is separated from an outer relief circle by a shallow groove (1).    This bird stamp seal has the harmonious proportions and soft lines typical of the Argive Geometric style of cast bronze figurines (2). J. Boardman believes that only bronze seals with designs rendered in intaglio were actually employed for impression in soft materials like wax or clay (3). Those with patterns in relief, like the Harvard example, were probably decorative imitations inspired by true seal forms. This seal could have been worn suspended as a necklace or belt ornament, or it may have stood alone on its base. However, there are far too few known impressions of seals like this one, nor examples of the seals themselves, to support this assertion. This object was probably intended as a votive object as well as a stamp (4).     NOTES:   1. On single bird pendants on bases, see I.

The flat rim, 1.35 cm in width, extends slightly beyond the vessel’s wall. The outer surface is slightly convex but tapers slightly downward. Beneath the rim is a concave zone (0.7 cm wide), below which is a frieze of sea creatures swimming to the left in low relief. The creatures appear to be (from left to right): a ketos with goat head looking backward, a hippocamp with carefully rendered head and equine forelegs, a second ketos with a goat-like head facing forward, and the tail of a third ketos whose forepart is missing. A small fish swims left in front of the hippocamp; a small, round-tailed creature, perhaps a ray, swims between the head of the second ketos and the tail of the third. This frieze is bordered by a single ridge at the top and two ridges on the bottom. A concave zone separates the two bottom ridges. At the bottom is a trace of lotus and palmettes, where two lotuses flank a seven-petalled palmette.    These joining fragments probably belonged to a conical situla, or wine bucket. It is unusual, however, because it was not hammered, but rather cast, a technique that is rare among Classical Greek bronze vessels. The frieze of swimming marine creatures, including a hippocamp and ketoi, belongs to the “marine thiasos,” a subject popular in all media during the fourth century BCE (1). Such sea creatures occur both singly and as mounts for Nereids who accompany Thetis, Achilles’ mother, in bringing the new panoply made by Hephaistos to Achilles to replace his first suit of armor (2). Said to have been found at Olynthos, this vase may have been made in a Macedonian workshop.    The object most likely dates between 400 and 350 BCE.

A ring handle emerges from the top of the bell, without a visible separation, and is now missing its top. A hole at the top preserved remains of a wire for holding the now-lost clapper, possibly a later repair.   Square-based bells, usually with an angular loop-handle, were common over a long period of time and in many variations throughout the Roman Empire, probably going back to the Hellenistic period. (1).   Bells (Greek: kodon; Latin: tintinnabulum) have been used by many cultures since antiquity, including in the first millennium BCE Near East and the Greek and Roman world (2). Usually made of cast copper alloy with an iron clapper, there are also examples in silver and gold (Persian, Greek, Roman, and Egyptian), iron (Roman), terracotta (Greek, Babylonian, and Egyptian), or faience (Egyptian); the latter was probably mostly symbolic rather than functional. For modern copper alloy bells, a ratio of c. 78% copper and 22% tin is considered ideal, but ancient bells usually contain less tin and more lead (3). Ancient bells functioned as signal instruments, but their sound could also have symbolic meaning. Roman bells are attested as announcing the opening of markets and baths and the spraying of streets with water; they awakened and summoned slaves, were worn by horses and other animals, functioned as apotropaic and fertility-related amulets, and played a role in Dionysiac cults especially (4).

Jacobsthal to conclude that they were placed in a grave on the shoulders of the deceased (1).   1950.84.19 and 1950.84.20 preserve the upper parts of two dress pins with three flattened globes below a disc-shaped head. The globes are incised with fine vertical grooves and increase in size toward the top of the pin. On 1950.84.20, a ring separates the globes and marks the beginning and end of the sequence; on 1950.84.19, the single rings are replaced by pairs of rings. Both pins have a flat disc with a slightly upturned rim. The upper surface of the disc around the central knob is left plain on 1950.84.19 and is decorated with a rosette on 1950.84.20. The shafts of both pins are circular in section and taper toward the lower point. The now-bent shaft fragment 1950.84.21 may originally have been a lower part of 1950.84.20. 1950.84.22 consists of a thin, round shaft, with a piece of wire wrapped tightly around one portion; the shaft and spiral are incompletely preserved. 1950.84.22 was reportedly part of the same find, and it might represent the tip of a pin, equipped with a point-guard or fastener (2). Alternatively, it may be a fragment of a loop-head pin (“Schlaufennadel”) (3).    There are relatively few Archaic pins with three globes, but these appear to have been more frequent in the northern Aegean. Examples from the late sixth century BCE from Macedonia have heads decorated with an incised rosette or a gold sheet bearing a rosette pattern, but the pins are more slender with more strongly articulated vertical subdivisions of the globes, and the discs have more elaborate rims (4). These comparisons suggest that the Harvard pin fragments are somewhat earlier: a date between the late seventh and mid-sixth centuries BCE would correspond roughly to the date range of their alleged find context (5).

Its leech-shaped body, oval in section, is surmounted at its highest point by a bead with a raised ring at the top. Two other raised rings, one at each end of the body, set it off from the catchplate on one side and from the pin on the other. The pin is square in section. The top edge of the rectangular catchplate dips down and then curves up, forming a jutting tab with a beaded finial.    On side A of the catchplate, the incised decoration shows a stag facing right, its head pointed upwards, and its front and back legs held apart as if in movement. Vertical parallel lines fill the body. Surrounding the stag is a border of dotted, concentric semicircles inside two multiple borders. The catchplate’s side B has similar multiple borders framing a meander pattern. Corrosion obscures some of the incision on this side of the catchplate, and part of its bottom edge and corner is missing.   NOTES:   1. Compare K.

This familiar opposition, often seen on Greek Geometric period fibulae, is probably emblematic of the antipathetic elemental environments of water, home to fish, and dry land, populated by animals and men. The style of the draftsmanship is Thessalian, probably from Philia (1). The fragment has no original edge, but most of the ornamentation has been preserved.   The horse faces left, framed in an elaborate border. The neck is upright with the muzzle of the head pointed downward. A squiggly line falls from the mouth, likely representing a stream of water. The horse’s weight rests on pointed hooves, and the front and back legs do not overlap. The outline of the horse’s body is filled with parallel lines. Two double triangles are placed on a groundline, one between the front legs and the other between the back. A single line depicts a drooping tail. Another line at the top of the head indicates the forelock. Above the back floats an asterisk-like object. Diagonal lines are present in the upper right corner. From the outside edge, the frame consists of multiple lines, then dotted concentric semicircles facing inward, then a line, then two broken lines, and finally another line.   On the opposite side an identical border frames four stacked fish facing right. Parallel lines decorate their bodies, which are curved downward. Matching pairs of fins are placed near the tails and a single fin atop each head. Diagonal lines fill the upper right corner.   Incised imagery on Greek plate fibulae of the Geometric period is concentrated on the double-sided catchplate, which secures the pin in its upturned bottom edge. A number of such catchplates at Harvard are fragmentary, making specific fibula types difficult to identify. Comparisons with similar incised fibulae suggest Thessalian origins for all of these catchplate fragments (2).    Formal features of fibula catchplates present particular decorative opportunities. Because they are double-sided, an oppositional comparison between the two sides is implicit. In many cases artisans appear to have taken advantage of this feature by presenting images that may stand for environmental oppositions, such as horse (land) contrasting with fish (water) (3). Also, the rectangular contours of catchplates naturally provide a frame for the decorative compositions, which encouraged the common practice of elaborate borders cold worked into the bronze.

It features the popular juxtaposition of stacked fish on one side and a horse and bird on the opposite side. Similar oppositional images on other Greek fibulae suggest a persistent interest in dividing the world into contrasting environments. Much of the catchplate is preserved including about half of the folded edge that once held the pin.     The contours of the stacked fish are more strongly curved along the top than the bottom. They have double outlines and triangular fins near their fan-shaped tails. Double vertical lines divide each fish in half. Additional vertical tremolo lines add texture to their bodies. Their heads are featureless. Multiple lines embellish their fins and tails. Two rows of dotted semicircles punctuate wide borders of multiples lines. Within this frame, diagonal lines form a triangle in the upper left corner.    The borders appear identical on the opposite side. There the corroded surface only allows a partial view of a horse facing right and standing over a water bird. Additional disconnected shapes appear above the horse, and multiple diagonal lines in the upper right corner form a triangle.

The lions have rather long ears, which point back as if to indicate agitation. Their mouths are open, and their muzzles are wrinkled in a snarl, as if roaring. The fur of the manes and bodies on the reclining lions is indicated by very short, layered incised lines. Their manes are marked off as one mass of hood-like fur, leaving their faces bare, and their swishing tails are also picked out in curving incised lines between their bent back legs. The tops of their ears are decorated with a crisscross pattern. The rivets for attachment to the vessel are preserved under the forepaws of the reclining lions. The large, central lion’s head, which extends from the top of the handle, would have looked into the contents of the pitcher. The central lion’s head is tilted slightly to the left, its mouth is partly open with its snout wrinkled. There is a raised ridge running down the spine of the handle. On either side of the ridge are double incised lines. The first two are diagonal, the others horizontal, in three groups. The base of the handle is decorated in a palmette topped with a head, perhaps meant to represent a siren (1). The head has a cap of fringed hair and a small triangular face. Two volutes transition into palmette leaves at the bottom. Above the volutes are what appear to be either wings or upturned palmette leaves, framing the face.    NOTES:   1. F.

There is no existing front-plate. One supporting ribbon runs along and under the catchplate, while the second is above and perpendicular to the catchplate. The wire pin of the square section is missing from the spring to the tip, and part of the pin hook on the clasp is lost. There are two minor wire losses on the outer edge of the spirals. The soil next to the spring has impressions of a small shell and a herringbone pattern.   Tightly spiraled wires with a decorative plate comprise the quatrefoil type fibulae. They stand upright like a brooch and function as a fastener for clothing. The Harvard Art Museums has a collection of ten complete quatrefoils in addition to spiral, front-plate, and catchplate fragments. The distinguishing elements of the fibulae are the two double spirals of round wire stacked perpendicular to one another and riveted together in the center. Within this collection, decorative front plates are either square (1987.135.1, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, and 1987.135.17) or lozenge-shaped (1987.135.9 and 1987.135.16), and five of them have punched decoration in the form of dots that follow the perimeter and cross the center diagonally. The catchplate spans the length of one double spiral and is attached by a central rivet. The clasp mechanism incorporates a spring and pin at one end and a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin on the other end. To keep the spirals from bending out of plane, some of the fibulae have ribbons of metal that crisscross the double spirals on the back and fold over onto the front (1987.135.4, 1987.135.5, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, 1987.135.8, and 1987.135.9).   The quatrefoil type of fibula was common in Italy and was probably introduced by way of the Balkans or Greece (1). Different localities played with the shape and decoration of the front-plates, making it common to find a variety of forms manufactured during the Iron Age. Quatrefoils are an elaboration on the spectacle fibula that has a design using only one double spiral, such as 1952.15 and 1952.112. Variations in the quatrefoil form can be seen in their size, front-plate shape, embossed decoration, and catchplate. Quatrefoil fibulae earlier than Harvard’s group have a catch made by extending and shaping the wire from one of the double spirals. The Harvard fibulae, in contrast, have a separate catchplate that has been formed from sheet metal and joined mechanically by a rivet. The earliest catchplate of this sort was found in Sicily and from there spread to Italy. 1987.135.17 is the only fibula in Harvard’s collection that has a hammered, flat spiral for a catchplate. Also common in Sicily are fibulae with embossed and square or lozenge-shaped front-plates.

303882,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The single coil fragment is broken at the outside end. The shape is slightly distorted. Fragments of sheet metal are attached on one side.    Tightly spiraled wires with a decorative plate comprise the quatrefoil type fibulae. They stand upright like a brooch and function as a fastener for clothing. The Harvard Art Museums has a collection of ten complete quatrefoils in addition to spiral, front-plate, and catchplate fragments. The distinguishing elements of the fibulae are the two double spirals of round wire stacked perpendicular to one another and riveted together in the center. Within this collection, decorative front plates are either square (1987.135.1, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, and 1987.135.17) or lozenge-shaped (1987.135.9 and 1987.135.16), and five of them have punched decoration in the form of dots that follow the perimeter and cross the center diagonally. The catchplate spans the length of one double spiral and is attached by a central rivet. The clasp mechanism incorporates a spring and pin at one end and a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin on the other end. To keep the spirals from bending out of plane, some of the fibulae have ribbons of metal that crisscross the double spirals on the back and fold over onto the front (1987.135.4, 1987.135.5, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, 1987.135.8, and 1987.135.9).   The quatrefoil type of fibula was common in Italy and was probably introduced by way of the Balkans or Greece (1). Different localities played with the shape and decoration of the front-plates, making it common to find a variety of forms manufactured during the Iron Age. Quatrefoils are an elaboration on the spectacle fibula that has a design using only one double spiral, such as 1952.15 and 1952.112. Variations in the quatrefoil form can be seen in their size, front-plate shape, embossed decoration, and catchplate. Quatrefoil fibulae earlier than Harvard’s group have a catch made by extending and shaping the wire from one of the double spirals. The Harvard fibulae, in contrast, have a separate catchplate that has been formed from sheet metal and joined mechanically by a rivet. The earliest catchplate of this sort was found in Sicily and from there spread to Italy. 1987.135.17 is the only fibula in Harvard’s collection that has a hammered, flat spiral for a catchplate. Also common in Sicily are fibulae with embossed and square or lozenge-shaped front-plates. The provenience of the Harvard quatrefoil fibulae is unknown; they are, however, stylistically similar to those found after 850 BCE throughout Italy and Sicily (2).    NOTES:    1. J.

The existing fragment includes the rest of the disc and the catchplate. Fragment 1987.135.23 attaches to the break join on this disc. The top of the disc has five raised bands that arc across the center of the round plate. The bands start and finish where the catchplate and pin are located on the disc. The edges around the top of the disc have incised lines creating repeating triangles. On either side of the center band is a swastika incised using tremolo lines. There are two cracks in the plate near the catchplate. The overall shape of the plate is slightly distorted. Four gouges in the center of the plate have removed corrosion. The surface has light green and blue corrosion overall and minor burial accretions.   The Harvard collection of disc fibulae includes seven fragments of the same type of large disc fibula. The characteristics of this particular type include a large, round bow composed of a disc made from thin sheet metal, the largest of which has a diameter of 13 cm. One edge of the disc has a wire spring with a pin, while the opposite edge has a catchplate. The components of each fibula are all created from one piece of metal. In contrast to other disc fibulae, where the actual disc portion is part of the catchplate, the Harvard fibulae integrate the disc as part of the bow. The thin disc when viewed from the top is slightly concave, and the surface has five bands that arc across the sheet as if imitating the veins of a leaf. Other incised decorations common to these disc fragments are swastikas and border decorations.    The large size of the decorative disc fibulae suggests that they could not be used as purely utilitarian fasteners and indicates the main allure was their decorative style. Few complete examples of this type of fibula have been documented. Since the Harvard disc fibulae are all fragmented, it is difficult to suggest how the spring and pin were configured in relation to the bow.

303886,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This lunate razor has a small ring handle, broken at the end. There are no traces of decorative spurs on the remaining section of the handle. The blade is of uniform thickness, and there are no surviving indications of decoration. A large section of the blade, just beyond the midpoint, was broken off and reattached. The edge of the blade is heavily chipped. The surface patina is pale olive green with some areas of light brown encrustation.   The razor is an example of V. Bianco Peroni’s type “Quattro Fontanili,” dated from the ninth to eighth centuries BCE and typically found within Villanovan areas (e.g., Tarquinia, Vulci, and Veii) (1).   It is difficult to understand the use and symbolism of the bronze objects from Iron Age Italy that are classified as razors. Possibly used for trimming hair or beards, these razors seem to have had some symbolic value. They are typically found in male burials, and their inclusion in grave goods may indicate that the deceased was a man of mature age; or, in cases where they are found in female burials, they may be indicative of the owner’s elevated social status (2). Some razors have been found with fibulae fastened through the handle, demonstrating that they could be worn (3). Many examples have repaired handles, showing that the razors were important enough to fix if broken (4).   Razors are typically plain or covered with incised decoration, most frequently lines, bands of interlocking triangles, meanders, lines of dots hatched swastikas, and Maltese crosses. The two-edged examples, like 1987.135.28, more often bear incised concentric circles or have decorative perforations on the blade. Often there are decorative spurs, crescents, or volutes on the handles, depending on the type.            NOTES:    1. V.

His right arm is raised with fist clenched, as if to throw a spear or a stone. His left arm is bent and a round shield (1.1 cm in diameter) is attached by a strap on the upper arm. The thick, short legs are bent at the knees and stand on a plate (2.1 x 0.75 cm). His long penis is attached to the plate between his feet. The back is modeled with pronounced buttocks. His head is turned toward his left. His eyes and mouth are summarily indicated, and the nose is sharp. He is nude except for a circlet around the head with two sharp peaks over the brow.   Long torsos, large heads, stubby legs, and exaggerated genitals characterize grotesque figures that came into vogue in the Hellenistic period and remained popular with the Romans. The origin of the type is generally associated with Alexandria, and a connection has been made with the stubby figures of the Egyptian god Bes. There are examples of single bronze figures shown bearded and nude, representing soldiers or gladiators and caricatures of Herakles (1).   The function of this figure is difficult to determine. If the figure were cast with the hole through the belly, it would appear to have been intended as an amulet, but the plate—also original—suggests the figure was used as a decorative attachment.

He wears no headdress but has a uraeus on his forehead and the standard side-lock. The figure extends an elongated finger towards his mouth; his proper left hand, now missing, would have been held beside his thigh. A large, crudely executed navel marks the schematic treatment of his body. Possible traces of a broad collar can be discerned on the back, and a fold of fat indicated on his chest suggests the presence of a now-invisible pectoral. The legs have been filed just below the buttocks.   Harpokrates represents the god Horus as a child, shown nude with the side-lock of youth on the right side of his head and his right index finger to his mouth. As the son of Osiris and Isis, he gained immense popularity during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, during which time the production of bronze figurines of Harpokrates flourished. He often wears the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, a feature common in first millennium Egypt when youthful deities acquired kingly attributes. Another characteristic headdress is the nemes head cloth, although frequently the boy is depicted with either a shaven head or a tight-fitting skull cap. His nude body typically retains the roundness of flesh associated with young boys. The child-god could be represented seated, striding, or squatting. When seated, he assumes a semi-reclining position derived from that of a baby on its mother’s lap; many of the smaller examples of these figurines may originally have belonged with a seated Isis figure (1). Suspension loops for attachment as a pendant indicate an amuletic connection that may have been particularly associated with young children.    NOTES:   1. G.

303902,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A number of bronze pin fragments are said to have been discovered on a slope right above the sea at Chalcedon (modern Kadıköy), a Megarian Greek colony across the Bosporus from Byzantium (modern Istanbul). The pin fragments were reportedly found just over 40 cm apart together with the remains of human bones, which led P. Jacobsthal to conclude that they were placed in a grave on the shoulders of the deceased (1).   1950.84.19 and 1950.84.20 preserve the upper parts of two dress pins with three flattened globes below a disc-shaped head. The globes are incised with fine vertical grooves and increase in size toward the top of the pin. On 1950.84.20, a ring separates the globes and marks the beginning and end of the sequence; on 1950.84.19, the single rings are replaced by pairs of rings. Both pins have a flat disc with a slightly upturned rim. The upper surface of the disc around the central knob is left plain on 1950.84.19 and is decorated with a rosette on 1950.84.20. The shafts of both pins are circular in section and taper toward the lower point. The now-bent shaft fragment 1950.84.21 may originally have been a lower part of 1950.84.20. 1950.84.22 consists of a thin, round shaft, with a piece of wire wrapped tightly around one portion; the shaft and spiral are incompletely preserved. 1950.84.22 was reportedly part of the same find, and it might represent the tip of a pin, equipped with a point-guard or fastener (2). Alternatively, it may be a fragment of a loop-head pin (“Schlaufennadel”) (3).    There are relatively few Archaic pins with three globes, but these appear to have been more frequent in the northern Aegean. Examples from the late sixth century BCE from Macedonia have heads decorated with an incised rosette or a gold sheet bearing a rosette pattern, but the pins are more slender with more strongly articulated vertical subdivisions of the globes, and the discs have more elaborate rims (4). These comparisons suggest that the Harvard pin fragments are somewhat earlier: a date between the late seventh and mid-sixth centuries BCE would correspond roughly to the date range of their alleged find context (5).

A similarly cylindrical, elongated neck rises from the front quarters at a slight angle to the back. The animal’s elongated muzzle curves slightly downward. Two short ears project backward from the head. There may be traces of a transverse incision across the top of the head. All four feet are missing. The legs are broken off at the knees, except for the left front leg, which extends downward almost to the hoof. The underpart of the hindquarters and tail is deeply hollowed out. The tail, a small rectangular tab, hangs from the hindquarters. Its right edge adheres to the rear edge of the right rear leg.    The slender proportions, elongated muzzle, and short tail indicate that this animal is a deer, probably a doe. It may have rested upon an elongated rectangular base that in turn was supported by an openwork cage or other kind of rounded feature (1). It is a valuable addition to a still limited group of deer statuettes from northern Greece (2).    NOTES:   1. As in 1984.196.   2. For parallels, see I.

303904,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Much of the surface area of this fibula catchplate is missing, leaving an irregular jagged edge. Nevertheless, it is possible to assign it to a Thessalian workshop at Philia or Pherai based on the incised ornamentation of comparable fibulae (1).   One side shows a horse facing left. The tail is a single line, and a pattern of diagonal parallel lines gives texture to its left thigh. Two double triangles filled with horizontal parallel lines rest on the groundline, one between the front and another between the rear legs. Another triangle with diagonal hatched lines occupies the lower left corner, and another undecorated triangle is attached to it. Multiple borders containing a row of dotted semicircles frame the scene.   Similar rows of dotted semicircles appear on the other side, part of a border now almost completely missing. Inside, a running meander is decorated with diagonal hatchings. Dotted semicircles embellish the pattern.   Incised imagery on Greek plate fibulae of the Geometric period is concentrated on the double-sided catchplate, which secures the pin in its upturned bottom edge. A number of such catchplates at Harvard are fragmentary, making specific fibula types difficult to identify. Comparisons with similar incised fibulae suggest Thessalian origins for all of these catchplate fragments (2).    Formal features of fibula catchplates present particular decorative opportunities. Because they are double-sided, an oppositional comparison between the two sides is implicit. In many cases artisans appear to have taken advantage of this feature by presenting images that may stand for environmental oppositions, such as horse (land) contrasting with fish (water) (3). Also, the rectangular contours of catchplates naturally provide a frame for the decorative compositions, which encouraged the common practice of elaborate borders cold worked into the bronze.

303906,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Two bronze birds stand side by side on a thin, rectangular base; the object is solid cast in one piece. The tail on one bird is partially missing, and the tail on the other is completely missing. The patina is dark green; the surface shows corrosion in places. The virtually identical birds are joined at their upper necks by a flat, horizontal strut. Both heads and bodies are featureless and free of any surface decoration.   Each bird balances on a single, rounded, post-like leg that rises from the rectangular base. Plain on its upper surface, the underside of the base bears a relief band around the periphery and an irregularly executed zigzag that crosses the rectangle lengthwise.    While the species of bird is indeterminate, their spoon-shaped bills and indications of widened tails are reminiscent of bronze representations of ducks in the Greek Geometric period. Their elongated, post-like supports, however, are more consistent with the appearance of storks, herons, and other long-legged waterfowl. Accordingly, we might see this pair as water birds standing in their element, where the raised zigzag on the underside of the base, seen from below, might stand for the water itself.   I. Kilian-Dirlmeier has noted the frequency of doubling among bird and animal figurines and pendants in the Geometric period. She believes that the function of the cross-strut linking such twin creatures was for suspending them and should not be interpreted literally as a yoke (1).   The rectangular base of the Harvard piece is unusual (2). Pairs of birds with cross-struts and round bases are known from Pherai and Olympia (3). This group may well be attributed to a Thessalian workshop active in the second half of the eighth century BCE.   NOTES:   1.

303907,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This lively, youthful figure of a dancing Lar is shown with his right leg forward and slightly bent, with the ball of the foot holding his weight, and his left leg slightly behind it. He wears a short-sleeved tunic held by a fibula on each shoulder and bound by a cinctus (sash) twisted at his back and drawn through two loops at the waist. Mappae (waist scarves) billow wing-like to either side of his short tunic, which has pleats on both sides of the legs in the front and falls in scalloped curves in the back. His back is somewhat flat and is covered by the folds of the garment. His high, open-toed boots reach mid-calf and are decorated with a rosette. They are laced up the front and the laces are looped at the top and fall in a triangle down each side of the ankle. The left arm is raised, and the missing hand would have held aloft a rhyton (a drinking horn often ending in the protome of an animal, such as a ram). The right arm is bent and the missing hand would have extended a patera (offering dish) or a situla (bucket), positioned as if to receive wine poured from the rhyton (1).   His head is raised, looking up and to the viewer's right, with the mouth partially open. His upturned eyes are outlined; the pupils are not punched. His hair is combed in rays at the back that terminate in a circlet of stiff curls around the face, rising vertically in the front (the top curl is broken or abraded at the peak) and arranged horizontally on the sides of the head.   When the figure was restored, metal was added under the right foot to provide stability. The toes of the left foot barely touch the ground, which suggests the original was not intended to stand alone but was supported at the opening under the kilt (1.35 x 0.87 cm) behind the right leg.   The Lar was the premier protective divinity of the Roman household. He resided in a shrine, or lararium, most often placed in the atrium or near the kitchen, usually with other divinities. When the emperor Augustus reorganized the cult in 7 BCE, the dancing figure was associated with the lares compitales who were worshipped at altars at the crossroads within each district of the city (2). The altars depicted the togate figure of the divine Augustus making a sacrifice, an image fundamental to the Imperial cult. Early Imperial reliefs of these ceremonial processions depicted small statuettes of Lares attached to bases being carried by participants (3). By the mid-first century CE the dancing Lar appears in domestic shrines in Italy and spreads soon thereafter into the provinces. The image of the emperor comes to represent the spirit (genius) of the father of the family, the pater familias (4). Two Lares often appear as paired mirror images flanking the genius or other divinity both in painted lararia and in bronze groups. Lararia appear in paintings in the fourth style of Pompeiian interior decoration, which is generally thought to have come into use when houses were redecorated after the earthquake of 62 CE (5).   The Harvard Lar closely resembles bronze Lares found at Pompeii and others represented in painting. The pyramidal hairdo with the stiff curls is especially similar to that of the bronze Lares from the House of the Wine Merchants, as well as to a pair of painted Lares and the single Lar statuette from the House of Lollius Synhodus, which is dated to the Neronian or Flavian period (6). G. M. A. Hanfmann favored a Flavian or Trajanic date for the Harvard example (7).   Exact dating for bronze Lares has proven elusive, as the types remained constant throughout the life of the cult, which was practiced throughout the empire from the first to the end of the fourth centuries CE (8).

The fragmented double spiral is bent under the neighboring spiral.   Tightly spiraled wires with a decorative plate comprise the quatrefoil type fibulae. They stand upright like a brooch and function as a fastener for clothing. The Harvard Art Museums has a collection of ten complete quatrefoils in addition to spiral, front-plate, and catchplate fragments. The distinguishing elements of the fibulae are the two double spirals of round wire stacked perpendicular to one another and riveted together in the center. Within this collection, decorative front plates are either square (1987.135.1, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, and 1987.135.17) or lozenge-shaped (1987.135.9 and 1987.135.16), and five of them have punched decoration in the form of dots that follow the perimeter and cross the center diagonally. The catchplate spans the length of one double spiral and is attached by a central rivet. The clasp mechanism incorporates a spring and pin at one end and a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin on the other end. To keep the spirals from bending out of plane, some of the fibulae have ribbons of metal that crisscross the double spirals on the back and fold over onto the front (1987.135.4, 1987.135.5, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, 1987.135.8, and 1987.135.9).   The quatrefoil type of fibula was common in Italy and was probably introduced by way of the Balkans or Greece (1). Different localities played with the shape and decoration of the front-plates, making it common to find a variety of forms manufactured during the Iron Age. Quatrefoils are an elaboration on the spectacle fibula that has a design using only one double spiral, such as 1952.15 and 1952.112. Variations in the quatrefoil form can be seen in their size, front-plate shape, embossed decoration, and catchplate. Quatrefoil fibulae earlier than Harvard’s group have a catch made by extending and shaping the wire from one of the double spirals. The Harvard fibulae, in contrast, have a separate catchplate that has been formed from sheet metal and joined mechanically by a rivet. The earliest catchplate of this sort was found in Sicily and from there spread to Italy. 1987.135.17 is the only fibula in Harvard’s collection that has a hammered, flat spiral for a catchplate. Also common in Sicily are fibulae with embossed and square or lozenge-shaped front-plates.

303910,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Two double spirals, a square front-plate, and a catchplate are mechanically joined together in the center by a rivet. The front-plate has losses along the perimeter, and its surface has dots stamped in repoussé along the edges and diagonally across the center. The catchplate is missing adjacent to the rivet and leading to the pin hook. The pin tip is missing from the spring. The spirals are partially uncoiled from the center and distorted in shape.    Tightly spiraled wires with a decorative plate comprise the quatrefoil type fibulae. They stand upright like a brooch and function as a fastener for clothing. The Harvard Art Museums has a collection of ten complete quatrefoils in addition to spiral, front-plate, and catchplate fragments. The distinguishing elements of the fibulae are the two double spirals of round wire stacked perpendicular to one another and riveted together in the center. Within this collection, decorative front plates are either square (1987.135.1, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, and 1987.135.17) or lozenge-shaped (1987.135.9 and 1987.135.16), and five of them have punched decoration in the form of dots that follow the perimeter and cross the center diagonally. The catchplate spans the length of one double spiral and is attached by a central rivet. The clasp mechanism incorporates a spring and pin at one end and a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin on the other end. To keep the spirals from bending out of plane, some of the fibulae have ribbons of metal that crisscross the double spirals on the back and fold over onto the front (1987.135.4, 1987.135.5, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, 1987.135.8, and 1987.135.9).   The quatrefoil type of fibula was common in Italy and was probably introduced by way of the Balkans or Greece (1). Different localities played with the shape and decoration of the front-plates, making it common to find a variety of forms manufactured during the Iron Age. Quatrefoils are an elaboration on the spectacle fibula that has a design using only one double spiral, such as 1952.15 and 1952.112. Variations in the quatrefoil form can be seen in their size, front-plate shape, embossed decoration, and catchplate. Quatrefoil fibulae earlier than Harvard’s group have a catch made by extending and shaping the wire from one of the double spirals. The Harvard fibulae, in contrast, have a separate catchplate that has been formed from sheet metal and joined mechanically by a rivet. The earliest catchplate of this sort was found in Sicily and from there spread to Italy. 1987.135.17 is the only fibula in Harvard’s collection that has a hammered, flat spiral for a catchplate. Also common in Sicily are fibulae with embossed and square or lozenge-shaped front-plates. The provenience of the Harvard quatrefoil fibulae is unknown; they are, however, stylistically similar to those found after 850 BCE throughout Italy and Sicily (2).    NOTES:    1. J.

The surface of the wire has a ribbed texture running parallel to the axis. There is a single groove visible under the stereomicroscope along the bow leading to the catchplate. There are minor bends in the pin. The surface has green corrosion and thick burial accretions overall, especially in the catchplate.   The serpentine fibula has an elegant form that consists of a single length of wire formed into a crescent-shaped fastener for clothing. One end of the wire has been sharpened into a point to puncture the cloth, while the opposite end has been shaped into a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin. Two single springs incorporated into the wire apply tension between the catchplate and pin. The section between the springs, called the bow, curves in harmony with the arch of the pin. There are nineteen serpentine fibulae in the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, and these fibulae have minor stylistic variations in form and decoration. They have no known provenience; however, serpentine fibulae were common during the Iron Age, and they are found distributed throughout Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and France (1).    The serpentine type of fibula is considered to have descended from the Late Bronze Age violin-bow type, which has a straight pin and a single spring. Replacing the violin-bow, the serpentine fibulae came into general use during the Early Iron Age, and the type continued to be used throughout the next half century. During this time, communities created their own types of fibulae, and discrete variations in the form developed. Trade in Italy during the eighth century BCE contributed to the spread of provincial styles; as a result, the traceability of their origins has been complicated. Serpentine fibulae were common in Sicily during Greek colonization, hence the type has also been termed “Sicilian” (2). Changes in the form have been used to date serpentine fibulae, the earliest of which have a flattened spiral catchplate. As the Iron Age progressed, the catchplate developed into a simple, folded channel, which became longer over time (3). 1987.135.53 and 1987.135.40 have the longest catchplates in the collection and probably date to the Late Iron Age, while the remaining fibulae with shorter catchplates are most likely from the Early Iron Age.

His facial features, aside from the prominent nose, are only slightly indicated. It is unclear if raised ovals on each side of the head indicate ears or if these are an element of the helmet’s cheek pieces. The figure has a pointed chin and an angular jaw; his face is tilted slightly upward. His short neck is broad and rather flat. The torso of the figure is unnaturally broad, probably to accommodate the wide fold of the tunic edge. The left shoulder is short, and his upper left arm is pressed closely to the body and bent at the elbow; only a faint incised line on the back indicates the separation of the arm from the body. His hand, which is not articulated, rests on his chest. His right arm, slightly curved but with no indication of an elbow, is held against his side; the hand is also not modeled. His long mantle ends above the ankles. The upper portion of the mantle is bordered by a sash or wide band, probably indicating folded cloth, running over his right shoulder down to under his left elbow. A raised vertical strip down the back of the right shoulder may indicate the corner of the garment. His lower legs are fused from the ankle downward; only a small triangular notch indicates the separation of the feet, and the toes are not indicated.   Thousands of small, anthropomorphic copper alloy statuettes and anatomical votives have been recovered from remote sanctuary sites in south-central Spain, particularly Collado de los Jardines and Castellar de Santisteban, but it is not certain to which god or gods they were dedicated (2). Many of the statuettes depict individuals, some of whom are represented in poses of prayer or offering (3). Some are very abstract and schematically rendered, while others wear identifiable contemporary clothing (4). In spite of the similarity of the votives, there is nothing to indicate that the intention behind each offering was the same.   NOTES:  1. Compare L.

The end of the handle that would have attached to the vessel is broken, but part of the decoration is visible, consisting of at least three raised rings, two of which may have been beaded. The shaft of the handle is fluted. At the juncture between the shaft and the ram’s head, there are raised bands of decoration consisting of a plain band flanked by two thinner beaded bands. The ram’s head is naturalistic and well modeled. Its horns coil around its ears, the tips of which point out horizontally. Snail-shaped curls of wool cover the top of the head and the neck. Both eyes are inlaid with silver. The snout and nostrils are modeled, while a line indicates the mouth.   This ram’s head and handle belonged to a shallow basin or patera intended for washing hands, usually used with a trefoil oinochoe (1).

303935,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The standard details of this ibis head—ridged beak and facial marking—are rendered with sensitivity for the musculature of the animal, seen in the subtle indentation of the throat and the graceful curving of the neck. The blunted end of the beak may be the result of a casting flaw or a later blow. The hollowed sockets probably held inlays for the eyes.   The Sacred Ibis bird derives its modern name from its ancient associations with the cult of Thoth, the moon god. Thoth regulated time and embodied wisdom, hence his connection with scribes, who identified him as the inventor of writing. As a manifestation of Thoth, the ibis participated in the growing prevalence of animal cults in the Late and Ptolemaic periods. The main cultic centers of Thoth were located at Saqqara, Abydos, Kom Ombo, and Tuna el-Gebel (ancient Hermopolis) where extensive catacombs of mummified ibises developed. The cultic site at Saqqara has revealed over 1.5 million mummies, and over 4 million come from the Tuna-el-Gebel catacombs (1). The birds used in these rites may have been raised by the temples specifically for this purpose. Most were buried in jars, some in ibis-shaped coffins. The two Harvard examples represent only the head, and both display tangs for attachment to the body cavities of ibis coffins. In addition to the mummified specimens, sculptural representations served as votives, examples of which have been excavated at Saqqara, Abydos, and Tuna el-Gebel (2).   Still present in Egypt in relatively large numbers until the 19th century, the Sacred Ibis’ distinctive posture and coloring lent itself to representation in a variety of media. With their long curving beaks and graceful legs, ibises appear in painted scenes of papyrus marshes or are represented sculpturally in a seated pose with legs bent underneath their bodies. A dominant characteristic—the two-tone coloring that contrasts dark beak, head, neck, legs, and wing tips with white body—was translated by the ancient artists into mixed media, most often bronze head, legs and tail affixed to a white-painted wooden body. More elaborate versions included gold, silver, and semi-precious stone inlays (3).    NOTES:   1. P. F.

The outer circumference is marked throughout by tiny serrations.   Despite the fine quality of workmanship visible in cutting, decorating, and perforating this disc, it is unclear what function it served or to what larger object it may have belonged. One possibility is that it was part of the central ornament on a miniature circular shield.

The left and right edges are preserved, but the top and bottom edges are broken away, leaving jagged contours. Multiple borders at the sides are embellished with dotted concentric semicircles facing inwards. From the preserved bottom edge toward the center, five horizontal bands are filled sporadically with dotted concentric semicircles and tremolo lines. Above, there are two framed rectangles containing hatched diamonds and tremolo lines. The use of multiple borders with dotted concentric semicircles compares with Thessalian workshop traditions (1).    Incised imagery on Greek plate fibulae of the Geometric period is concentrated on the double-sided catchplate, which secures the pin in its upturned bottom edge. A number of such catchplates at Harvard are fragmentary, making specific fibula types difficult to identify. Comparisons with similar incised fibulae suggest Thessalian origins for all of these catchplate fragments (2).    Formal features of fibula catchplates present particular decorative opportunities. Because they are double-sided, an oppositional comparison between the two sides is implicit. In many cases artisans appear to have taken advantage of this feature by presenting images that may stand for environmental oppositions, such as horse (land) contrasting with fish (water) (3).

The other side displays three horizontally stacked fish with double outlines and two triangular fins near the tails. Inside, the fish are decorated with vertical tremolo lines, four arcs near the heads, and multiple lines at the tails.    This fragment can be associated with Thessalian production, specifically at Philia (1), based on the particular use of tremolo lines as well as the representation of horse and bird on one side of the catchplate, which is set in opposition to stacked fish on the other side.

Similar borders of multiple lines enclose the images on both sides. The lines occasionally intersect at the corners.

Rocked zigzags fill the interior of the body, following its outlines. A jagged line runs down the center of the beak.   The three stacked fish also have double outlines. Their bodies are curved at the top and relatively straight at the bottom. Three curved lines separate their heads from the rest of their bodies.

303941,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This fragment of repoussé relief, probably from a box mirror, depicts a nude male figure seated facing to the left and the upper part of a draped female figure standing behind him. The top of his head and the left eye, the upper part of his left arm, his right thigh, and the lower parts of his legs are missing. His head is modeled almost in the round, with curls of hair rising on either side above his forehead. His nose is large; his mouth has full lips. At the edge of the break, on the left side of his head, is the base of an ear. A smaller, concave pointed ear is visible on the right side of the head, as seen from the front of the head. The presence of the pointed ear identifies the youthful figure as a young satyr. He raises his right arm and seems to gesture, holding up his second and third fingers. His left hand, which rests on top of his left leg, holds a separately fashioned bronze rod; the rod projects under his forearm, which is broken and missing. The satyr sits on a wavy mass of deeply modeled drapery.  The female figure’s head and lower body are missing. Her torso, framed between the youth’s head, right arm, and upraised right hand, is clad in a himation draped diagonally across her left shoulder. Her chiton has a V-shaped neck.  This figural fragment may have belonged to the cover of a box mirror, to a piece of body armor, or to the left cheek piece of a helmet. The pose and powerfully modeled anatomy of the satyr bring to mind the seated Dionysos on the Derveni krater. The date probably lies somewhere in the third quarter of the fourth century BCE. It may have been created in a Thessalian or Macedonian workshop.  David G. Mitten",NULL,NULL
303942,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This S-shaped couch attachment would have been fastened to the side of a wooden headboard (fulcrum) of the same shape, where it would have served as an elbow-rest on a couch (1). The perpendicular shelf at the back of the piece, running around its contours, allowed the attachment to fit like a bracket onto the headrest; it was then secured with nails. At the lower left of the attachment is a medallion with a high relief bust of a female figure, probably a maenad or nymph. The figure is clad in a chiton and himation; her chest is frontal, while her head is in three-quarter view, turned to her left with her chin raised and mouth slightly open. She wears a headband (mitra) on her forehead, with her hair in a Hellenistic top-knot (krobylos) and ivy or thick clumps of hair hanging over her shoulders. The slanted central portion of the piece is decorated with a relief of a sleeping maenad or Ariadne. The figure reclines on a rock, with her head and torso twisting to her left and her lower body twisting to her right; her left leg is crossed over the right, and her right arm is behind her head. The figure is nude except for drapery over the lower body and genitalia. She has a garland and bunches of grapes on her head, with long, curly locks of hair falling over her shoulders. There may be a cornucopia below the figure. The upper right of the piece ends in a lively horse protome: its mouth gapes, and its bridled head is turned down and to its right.   The fulcrum attachment cannot be easily dated. The fact that the attachment was cast solid as a single piece with a central relief section recalls several similar Hellenistic attachments (2). Its relatively small size (c. 28.7 cm on the diagonal) might also support such a date, since fulcrum attachments often became larger and more upright over time (3). Furthermore, the Harvard attachment has double acute angles where the horizontal bottom edge meets the adjacent sloping side, a feature that S. Faust dates from the late second to the early first centuries BCE through the first half of the first century CE (4).   This fulcrum attachment probably adorned a couch in the dining room (triclinium) of a Roman villa. Its decoration, including maenads and possibly Ariadne, the wife of Dionysos, suggests a Dionysian theme, which would have been an appealing subject for a dining couch. The orientation, with the medallion at the lower left and the protome at the upper right, indicates that the piece would have supported a diner reclining on his left side. Whether it was part of a set of mirror-image attachments, which sometimes decorated Roman couches, cannot be ascertained (5).   NOTES:   1. Following B. Barr-Sharrar, The Hellenistic and Early Imperial Decorative Bust (Mainz, 1987) 4, the term “fulcrum” is used to denote “headrest,” as in ancient sources, while “fulcrum attachment” will refer to the S-shaped piece affixed to its side.   2. For instance, see the fulcrum attachment in the Antikensammlung Berlin, inv. no. 30167; compare also ibid., no. C 104, pl. 34. However, Barr-Sharrar points out that not all such attachments are necessarily of Hellenistic date; see ibid., 60 and 101.   3. See ibid., 7. Some fulcrum attachments of a similar size may be dated to the imperial period; compare ead., “The Bronze Fulcrum Attachment: Some Clarifications in the Chronology of Solutions to this Problematic Format,” in Griechische und römische Statuetten und Grossbronzen: Akten der 9. Tagung über antike Bronzen in Wein 21.-25. April 1986, eds. K. Gschwantler and A. Bernhard-Walcher (Vienna, 1988) 279-84.

One corner of the front-plate and part of the catchplate hook are chipped and missing. The ribbon on the back follows the length of the catchplate and folds onto the front. The pin is broken 3.3 cm from the tip.  Tightly spiraled wires with a decorative plate comprise the quatrefoil type fibulae. They stand upright like a brooch and function as a fastener for clothing. The Harvard Art Museums has a collection of ten complete quatrefoils in addition to spiral, front-plate, and catchplate fragments. The distinguishing elements of the fibulae are the two double spirals of round wire stacked perpendicular to one another and riveted together in the center. Within this collection, decorative front plates are either square (1987.135.1, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, and 1987.135.17) or lozenge-shaped (1987.135.9 and 1987.135.16), and five of them have punched decoration in the form of dots that follow the perimeter and cross the center diagonally. The catchplate spans the length of one double spiral and is attached by a central rivet. The clasp mechanism incorporates a spring and pin at one end and a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin on the other end. To keep the spirals from bending out of plane, some of the fibulae have ribbons of metal that crisscross the double spirals on the back and fold over onto the front (1987.135.4, 1987.135.5, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, 1987.135.8, and 1987.135.9).   The quatrefoil type of fibula was common in Italy and was probably introduced by way of the Balkans or Greece (1). Different localities played with the shape and decoration of the front-plates, making it common to find a variety of forms manufactured during the Iron Age. Quatrefoils are an elaboration on the spectacle fibula that has a design using only one double spiral, such as 1952.15 and 1952.112. Variations in the quatrefoil form can be seen in their size, front-plate shape, embossed decoration, and catchplate. Quatrefoil fibulae earlier than Harvard’s group have a catch made by extending and shaping the wire from one of the double spirals. The Harvard fibulae, in contrast, have a separate catchplate that has been formed from sheet metal and joined mechanically by a rivet. The earliest catchplate of this sort was found in Sicily and from there spread to Italy. 1987.135.17 is the only fibula in Harvard’s collection that has a hammered, flat spiral for a catchplate. Also common in Sicily are fibulae with embossed and square or lozenge-shaped front-plates.

303949,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This pendant consists of a bird surmounting an elongated and a faceted, elliptical extension that tapers to a rounded point. A transverse perforation pierces the bird below its head. The bird, perhaps a duck, has a short tail marked by six parallel incised chevrons. The tip of the beak is missing. The crown of the head is corroded, but may have once had a crest. The eyes are modeled as raised pellets. The surface is formed by a smoothly polished light green patina. Tiny corroded spots appear elsewhere on the object. The bird rises from the terminal on a short post marked with four incised grooves. The pendant extension has faint vertical facets. These facets, of which there may be as many as nine, are not uniform in width.   Among the three types of facetted pendants that I. Kilian-Dirlmeier has described, two of them—Types A and B—are related to this piece (1). Type A is generally a plain, solid-cast, elongated oval shape, pierced at the top, with six, eight, or nine facets. Type B, of which the Harvard piece is an example, shows the same solid piriform element as Type A, surmounted by a bird with a pierced body, perching on a short, profiled post. The surfaces of these pendants have five, six, eight, or nine vertical facets. Pierced Type A pendants have been found in the Papatislures Cemetery at Kamiros, Rhodes, with small chains passed through their perforations, making it likely that these examples were worn as jewelry. Some pierced and unpierced Type A examples have also occurred in sanctuary deposits. Types A and B have both came from contexts at Pherai and Philia that strongly suggest they were items of personal jewelry, perhaps dedicated singly or worn as garment decorations (2). This pendant shows stylistic affinities with a pendant identified by Kilian-Dirlmeier as Thessalian (3).   NOTES:   1. For discussion of facetted pendants, see I.

303950,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The large size of this fibula fragment, as well as the style and subject matter of the opposed incised images, identify it as a product of a Thessalian workshop (1). No original edge is preserved.    One side depicts four stacked fish facing right. They are nearly identical, positioned with their tails above their heads. Their graceful asymmetrically curved outlines suggest undulating movement. Fins appear above and below the tails, and a single fin is placed under each pointed head. Each fish has a double outline, is bisected near the middle by three closely spaced vertical lines, and has rows of parallel vertical tremolo lines inside the outlines from tail to head. The area of the head is set apart by multiple vertical lines and a single horizontal line near the nose. Tail fins are filled with multiple parallel lines. Dotted concentric circles fill the spaces between the fish. Multiple borders frame the fish, punctuated by two rows of dotted semicircles facing inwards. The upper right corner of the frame is filled with multiple diagonal lines with a zigzag at the bottom.   Extensive corrosion covers most of the incision on the other side, but a horse facing left can just be discerned, as well as water birds, one above the horse’s back and another below the horse. The horse and water birds are framed by a very similar arrangement of multiple borders as on the opposite side. As seen so often in Thessalian fibulae, the opposition of fish and horses with water birds perhaps expresses an elemental division, the watery deep contrasted with the terrestrial world.    Incised imagery on Greek plate fibulae of the Geometric period is concentrated on the double-sided catchplate, which secures the pin in its upturned bottom edge. A number of such catchplates at Harvard are fragmentary, making specific fibula types difficult to identify. Comparisons with similar incised fibulae suggest Thessalian origins for all of these catchplate fragments (2).    Formal features of fibula catchplates present particular decorative opportunities. Because they are double-sided, an oppositional comparison between the two sides is implicit. In many cases artisans appear to have taken advantage of this feature by presenting images that may stand for environmental oppositions, such as horse (land) contrasting with fish (water) (3). Also, the rectangular contours of catchplates naturally provide a frame for the decorative compositions, which encouraged the common practice of elaborate borders cold worked into the bronze.

303951,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Formal and decorative features of this bow fibula point to Central Greece (1); specifically the decorative techniques of closely spaced punch marks and tremolo decoration (2) have parallels in Attic workmanship, while the central disc on the bow resembles Boeotian bow fibulae (3). It is likely that this fibula predates these parallels and may serve as a key to interpreting the iconography of an important group of Boeotian bow fibulae, which are characterized by large central discs surrounded by dense figural compositions incised on their crescent bows (4).    The largest surface area on the fibula is the sheet bronze bow, which is more arched at the top than the bottom. Single bead moldings, each with a raised ring above and below, terminate the narrow ends of the bow. The faceted extension at one end tapers to a double loop and straight across to the pointed end of the pin, which is held in the upturned bottom edge of the catchplate. The catchplate is flat like the bow and continues the bow’s arc, flaring into a rectangle.    Side B of the fibula preserves nearly all of the incised decoration (5). The bow has a thick border of tremolo lines, within which is a double zigzag with punch marks across the top and a diamond chain at the bottom. Inside the border, a central, radiate disc contains seven other discs half its size, which intersect to form a six-petal rosette. A rein connecting the muzzles of two confronted horses holds the disc aloft. A pair of birds confronts each other in the space between the horses and the disc. Two fish, one at each end of the crescent-shaped field, face downwards. A zigzag, a double zigzag, and a diamond chain—all embellished with fine punch marks—fill the tremolo border of the catchplate, which encloses a horse confronting a fish.   The Harvard bow fibula and the group of Boeotian bow fibulae reflect ideas found in early Greek epic poetry. The decoration of the Harvard bow fibula diagrams the route of Helios across the arc of heaven from dawn (eos) to dusk (zophos), as related in the Homeric Hymn to Helios (6). Parallel to the hymn’s account of the sun chariot pausing in its course, probably at mid-heaven, the fibula pictures Helios as a radiate disc positioned at the highest point in the sky, within a symmetrical composition mapping the sun’s daily arc. The composition embeds the sun chariot (horse–disc–horse) within a series of environmental icons (fish–horse–bird–disc–bird–horse–fish). of the Helios rises at dawn (eos) from Okeanos (fish) to Ouranos (bird), where he pauses at mid-heaven before heading back through Ouranos (bird) down into Okeanos (fish). On the catchplate, the horse, standing for Gaia, and the fish, standing for Okeanos or Pontos, represent the land and water divisions of the earthly zone. Geometric fibulae commonly show these two antithetical elemental spheres on opposite sides of their catchplates. The sequence, a–b–c–d–c–b–a, analogous to the schema on the Harvard belt, 1986.384, is a paratactic ring representing a day as a cyclic measure of time, or time signature. The sequence underlies a dynamic cosmology and symbolizes the cycle of a rising and setting Helios as connected to, engaged with, and influenced events in the mortal sphere.    Confirmation of this interpretation is found on a bow fibula in a private collection in New York, which was surely made by the same craftsman as the Harvard fibula. The decoration on side A of this matching fibula is nearly identical to side B of the Harvard fibula. However, on side B of the New York fibula, a human figure, Helios himself, is shown to the left of the radiate disc in the process of unreining one of his chariot horses at mid-heaven, just as it is described in the hymn.   The Harvard bow fibula diagrams the rising and setting sun as changing directional and environmental coordinates and degrees of illumination. Dawn equates with the east, life, light, and the past; on the other hand, dusk equates with the west, death, darkness, and the future. Synchronized with this cycle is the coordination of white with up and darkness with down. On the fibula, Helios is pictured at mid-heaven, when all of these polarities are held in cosmic balance, diagrammed on the fibula bow as a symmetrical sequence.    The route of Helios also calibrates the outcome of Homeric battles. The “high-noon” position of Helios on the fibula represents a celestial moment of divine judgment, when events on the Homeric battlefield hang in the balance. Symbolized in the Iliad as the golden scales of Zeus, no Homeric battle is decided before this heavenly verdict is delivered. Later Boeotian bow fibulae are decorated with similar large, centrally placed discs surrounded by a wide array of figures, including animal and human, as well as mythological and heroic. As with the Harvard fibula and its companion piece in New York, these also represent charged moments of cosmic reckoning when the route of Helios is in accord with fortunes on earth (7).

The distinguishing elements of the fibulae are the two double spirals of round wire stacked perpendicular to one another and riveted together in the center. Within this collection, decorative front plates are either square (1987.135.1, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, and 1987.135.17) or lozenge-shaped (1987.135.9 and 1987.135.16), and five of them have punched decoration in the form of dots that follow the perimeter and cross the center diagonally. The catchplate spans the length of one double spiral and is attached by a central rivet. The clasp mechanism incorporates a spring and pin at one end and a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin on the other end. To keep the spirals from bending out of plane, some of the fibulae have ribbons of metal that crisscross the double spirals on the back and fold over onto the front (1987.135.4, 1987.135.5, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, 1987.135.8, and 1987.135.9).   The quatrefoil type of fibula was common in Italy and was probably introduced by way of the Balkans or Greece (1). Different localities played with the shape and decoration of the front-plates, making it common to find a variety of forms manufactured during the Iron Age. Quatrefoils are an elaboration on the spectacle fibula that has a design using only one double spiral, such as 1952.15 and 1952.112. Variations in the quatrefoil form can be seen in their size, front-plate shape, embossed decoration, and catchplate. Quatrefoil fibulae earlier than Harvard’s group have a catch made by extending and shaping the wire from one of the double spirals. The Harvard fibulae, in contrast, have a separate catchplate that has been formed from sheet metal and joined mechanically by a rivet. The earliest catchplate of this sort was found in Sicily and from there spread to Italy. 1987.135.17 is the only fibula in Harvard’s collection that has a hammered, flat spiral for a catchplate. Also common in Sicily are fibulae with embossed and square or lozenge-shaped front-plates. The provenience of the Harvard quatrefoil fibulae is unknown; they are, however, stylistically similar to those found after 850 BCE throughout Italy and Sicily (2).    NOTES:    1. J.

The front-plate and the ribbon have minor losses. One corner of the catchplate and the tip of the pin are missing.   Tightly spiraled wires with a decorative plate comprise the quatrefoil type fibulae. They stand upright like a brooch and function as a fastener for clothing. The Harvard Art Museums has a collection of ten complete quatrefoils in addition to spiral, front-plate, and catchplate fragments. The distinguishing elements of the fibulae are the two double spirals of round wire stacked perpendicular to one another and riveted together in the center. Within this collection, decorative front plates are either square (1987.135.1, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, and 1987.135.17) or lozenge-shaped (1987.135.9 and 1987.135.16), and five of them have punched decoration in the form of dots that follow the perimeter and cross the center diagonally. The catchplate spans the length of one double spiral and is attached by a central rivet. The clasp mechanism incorporates a spring and pin at one end and a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin on the other end. To keep the spirals from bending out of plane, some of the fibulae have ribbons of metal that crisscross the double spirals on the back and fold over onto the front (1987.135.4, 1987.135.5, 1987.135.6, 1987.135.7, 1987.135.8, and 1987.135.9).   The quatrefoil type of fibula was common in Italy and was probably introduced by way of the Balkans or Greece (1). Different localities played with the shape and decoration of the front-plates, making it common to find a variety of forms manufactured during the Iron Age. Quatrefoils are an elaboration on the spectacle fibula that has a design using only one double spiral, such as 1952.15 and 1952.112. Variations in the quatrefoil form can be seen in their size, front-plate shape, embossed decoration, and catchplate. Quatrefoil fibulae earlier than Harvard’s group have a catch made by extending and shaping the wire from one of the double spirals. The Harvard fibulae, in contrast, have a separate catchplate that has been formed from sheet metal and joined mechanically by a rivet. The earliest catchplate of this sort was found in Sicily and from there spread to Italy. 1987.135.17 is the only fibula in Harvard’s collection that has a hammered, flat spiral for a catchplate. Also common in Sicily are fibulae with embossed and square or lozenge-shaped front-plates. The provenience of the Harvard quatrefoil fibulae is unknown; they are, however, stylistically similar to those found after 850 BCE throughout Italy and Sicily (2).   NOTES:    1. J.

The disc has been bent and distorted slightly. The surface has light green corrosion overall.    The Harvard collection of disc fibulae includes seven fragments of the same type of large disc fibula. The characteristics of this particular type include a large, round bow composed of a disc made from thin sheet metal, the largest of which has a diameter of 13 cm. One edge of the disc has a wire spring with a pin, while the opposite edge has a catchplate. The components of each fibula are all created from one piece of metal. In contrast to other disc fibulae, where the actual disc portion is part of the catchplate, the Harvard fibulae integrate the disc as part of the bow. The thin disc when viewed from the top is slightly concave, and the surface has five bands that arc across the sheet as if imitating the veins of a leaf. Other incised decorations common to these disc fragments are swastikas and border decorations.    The large size of the decorative disc fibulae suggests that they could not be used as purely utilitarian fasteners and indicates the main allure was their decorative style. Few complete examples of this type of fibula have been documented. Since the Harvard disc fibulae are all fragmented, it is difficult to suggest how the spring and pin were configured in relation to the bow.

Either end of the handle curves downward and then rises again, terminating in a knob similar to the central one. The inner sides of the handle and the front edges of the terminal knobs have slots aligned to fit snugly over the rim of the bowl or basin to which it was attached.    This piece resembles handles with central vertical knobs that appear on Athenian black-figure cups of the “Merrythought” variety, dated to c. 560 BCE. These cups clearly reflect models in silver or bronze. The other examples of this type of handle end in snake or lion heads, suggested by the sinuous form of the handle and the slots in the terminal knobs (1). Based on these parallels, a probable date for this handle would be around 525 to 500 BCE. While a mainland workshop may be involved, this piece could perfectly well also have fitted a bowl or basin made in one of the Greek cities in southern Italy or Sicily.   NOTES:   1.

A slight depression marks the dorsal spinal ridge and the space between the legs. The lower legs are broken at the ankles; the feet are missing.   Osiris was one of the most popular gods of the Egyptian pantheon. Early in Egyptian history he represented a chthonic fertility god that later acquired the royal insignia of the crook and flail. He came to be identified as the ruler of the underworld. The Egyptian ruler, perceived during his lifetime as the incarnation of Horus, became Osiris after death. Over time, Osiris was equated with all deceased individuals and became a symbol of resurrection. The major cult shrine of Osiris was at Abydos in Middle Egypt, where Seti I (c. 1294-1279 BCE) built a magnificent temple in Dynasty 19.   Small bronze figurines representing Osiris show the god wrapped in a form-fitting garment, perhaps denoting a mummified shroud, and carrying the symbols of rulership—the crook and flail—in each hand. Enveloped in his shroud, Osiris’ arms are bound close to his body and his feet and legs stand together. The god is usually depicted wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt, ornamented with a uraeus (cobra) on the front and sometimes flanked by two feathers (the atef crown). In addition, this crown can rest on a set of spiraling ram’s horns that project to either side.    The bronze figurines take two basic forms: seated or standing. Within each group, several subgroups can be distinguished according to the placement of the hands. The hands can be side-by-side without overlapping, the proper right hand above the left in a vertical alignment, or crossed over one another at the wrists. G.

303973,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The standing figure with a canine head represents Anubis. The god of embalmers, Anubis generally took a canine form, either as a crouching animal upon a shrine or as a composite with a canine head and a human body. The exact type of canine, whether dog or jackal, is uncertain, and may be a hybrid of the two animals. Credited with the invention of mummification, his representation was often included in tomb wall scenes and on various funerary goods, such as coffins or chests. Following the development of the Book of the Dead in the late Second Intermediate Period and early New Kingdom, Anubis began to appear in the vignettes of the illustrated manuscripts, most famously in the scenes accompanying Spell 125, where he would stand beside the great scales measuring the heart of the deceased against maat, or truth (1).    The small size of this figure has left little detailing visible. The short ears and rather blunted snout give only a vague sense of the canine nature of Anubis. He stands on a small oval base, striding forward with his proper left foot. Both arms are held close to the body and are thin wire, welded onto the body in a fairly clumsy manner.

His front and hind legs are cast in one piece. His long tail curves upward. His narrow muzzle projects forward from between two large ears. There is otherwise no surface decoration. This fox, whose natural agility is well characterized despite its small size, belongs to a group of cast animals and birds that were designed to decorate the outer rims of elaborate bronze mirrors supported by female and occasionally male figures. The animals on the rims of these caryatid mirror discs sometimes show foxes chasing hares, sometimes with roosters involved, a scene which perhaps descends from the hounds chasing hares on the lowest figural bands of Protocorinthian and transitional Corinthian figural vases dating from c. the middle of the seventh century BCE (1). A few examples of these animal disc-mirror decorations are surmounted by a small cast siren attachment used as the mount for a suspension ring. This fox would be very much at home as a component of a number of caryatid mirrors attributed to Corinthian or Athenian workshops produced during the first half of the fifth century BCE (2).   Foxes often occur as prey for human hunters, brought in hanging from a pole after capture. Foxes were also thought to be cunning creatures. The tondo of a red-figure cup in the Vatican shows a small fox sitting upright and conversing with Aesop (3).

The Uffizi faun has a round head, short tight curls, pointed ears, two short horns, a fleshy face, and an open mouth. But the statue’s appealing head, arms, and surely much more, are evidently all sixteenth century restorations, and those are the parts of the statue that have inspired the most enthusiasm in modern times, as well as the syncopatic nature that these features give to the whole. In 1695, this dancing faun was hailed as the most beautiful statue that one could see (1).   Copies of the statue were widely available—not only in Florence, but also in Rome and Naples (2). This reproduction of the head alone is particularly difficult to read if one wants to know about the whole figure. The hard, whitish accretions suggest that the head was intended to look like an antiquity to potential buyers, who would neither be familiar with the actual statue nor its modern restorations, of which the head was one.

The snake figurine most commonly takes a figure-eight pose with its head resting opposite from its tail, as in 1920.44.287 (2). The head and body markings are rendered by incised lines.

An inscription engraved in two registers on front of the container reads, “Atum give life to X-Osiris, son of Psamtik” (3). The name Psamtik occurs in Dynasty 26, placing this work among the earliest of the Egyptian bronzes in the collection. The god Atum, the creator god of Heliopolis, is associated with serpents (4), and the small bronze may have served an amuletic or votive (5).

303995,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The crook and flail on this Osiris statuette, held in the side-by-side arrangement, have been reversed, and the flail lacks its customary hanging strand of beads. A hieroglyphic inscription running down the front of the shroud is untranslatable. The flat body would have been attached to a base by the pin below the plinth-like feet, which join the legs at an obtuse angle. The headdress is missing the top proper right corner. Some concerns about the authenticity of this object are raised especially by the presence and location of the odd inscription (1).   Osiris was one of the most popular gods of the Egyptian pantheon. Early in Egyptian history he represented a chthonic fertility god that later acquired the royal insignia of the crook and flail. He came to be identified as the ruler of the underworld. The Egyptian ruler, perceived during his lifetime as the incarnation of Horus, became Osiris after death. Over time, Osiris was equated with all deceased individuals and became a symbol of resurrection. The major cult shrine of Osiris was at Abydos in Middle Egypt, where Seti I (c. 1294-1279 BCE) built a magnificent temple in Dynasty 19.   Small bronze figurines representing Osiris show the god wrapped in a form-fitting garment, perhaps denoting a mummified shroud, and carrying the symbols of rulership—the crook and flail—in each hand. Enveloped in his shroud, Osiris’ arms are bound close to his body and his feet and legs stand together. The god is usually depicted wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt, ornamented with a uraeus (cobra) on the front and sometimes flanked by two feathers (the atef crown). In addition, this crown can rest on a set of spiraling ram’s horns that project to either side.    The bronze figurines take two basic forms: seated or standing. Within each group, several subgroups can be distinguished according to the placement of the hands. The hands can be side-by-side without overlapping, the proper right hand above the left in a vertical alignment, or crossed over one another at the wrists. G. Roeder associates the different poses to geographical areas within Egypt: those with hands side-by-side in Middle Egypt, those with hands one above the other in Lower Egypt, and those with the hands crossed over one another in Upper Egypt (2). The position of the hands also appears to correlate with other broad stylistic features. For example, the ridge created by the shroud pulled around the shoulders occurs primarily on figurines in which the hands are arranged one above the other.   NOTES:   1. It is possible that the piece is authentic and the inscription a later addition, but there are also stylistic issues with this statuette. Inscriptions, when present on bronze Osiris statuettes, generally occur on the base rather than on the figure. Thanks to E. Russo, Brown University, for this information.   2. G.

A hole at the top preserves the remains of a wire for holding the now-lost clapper, but this is probably a later repair, since remains of an original loop for the clapper are also preserved on the interior of the bell. The base is curved, so that the bell, in effect, stands on its four corners. The handle, which now has its top broken off, had an angular exterior outline, similar to that of 1932.56.17.    Square-based bells, usually with an angular loop-handle, were common over a long period of time and in many variations throughout the Roman Empire, probably going back to the Hellenistic period (1).    Bells (Greek: kodon; Latin: tintinnabulum) have been used by many cultures since antiquity, including in the first millennium BCE Near East and the Greek and Roman world (2). Usually made of cast copper alloy with an iron clapper, there are also examples in silver and gold (Persian, Greek, Roman, and Egyptian), iron (Roman), terracotta (Greek, Babylonian, and Egyptian), or faience (Egyptian); the latter was probably mostly symbolic rather than functional. For modern copper alloy bells, a ratio of c. 78% copper and 22% tin is considered ideal, but ancient bells usually contain less tin and more lead (3). Ancient bells functioned as signal instruments, but their sound could also have symbolic meaning. Roman bells are attested as announcing the opening of markets and baths and the spraying of streets with water; they awakened and summoned slaves, were worn by horses and other animals, functioned as apotropaic and fertility-related amulets, and played a role in Dionysiac cults especially (4).

303998,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This stamp takes the shape of a foot and preserves a border around the edges of the stamp plate. The handle attached to the back of the plate does not consist of a ring but is rounded and has a small circular perforation. The text of this stamp is incomprehensible. It may be possible to identify individual letters, but the sense of the text is impossible to decipher. This may be an example of the use of imitation alphabetic characters (1).      Each of the six Roman bronze stamps in the Harvard Art Museums consists of a plate, on which the die of the stamp is carved, and a ring, attached to the back of the plate, which serves as a handle for applying the stamp (2). With the exception of 1977.216.3250, Harvard’s stamps are approximately the same size (c. 5-6 cm long and 2-3 cm wide), and all are inscribed with text. Stamps were produced in a variety of shapes. Most are rectangular, but they could also be elliptical, circular, rhomboid, or in the shape of a tabella ansata, a foot, or, less commonly, a hand. Five of the six stamps in the Harvard Art Museums are rectangular. Four of these have two lines of writing inscribed on them; one other rectangular stamp contains a single line of text, which is limited to initials. The sixth stamp, 1977.216.1963, takes the shape of a foot and also has only one line of writing. This stamp appears to contain pseudo-alphabetic characters. Four others are inscribed in Latin, with the lettering raised and written backwards, a mirror image of the text the stamp would produce. 1977.216.3250 is inscribed in Greek letters but not written retrograde, meaning that the stamp’s impression would have been backwards.   Many types of objects in the ancient world bore stamped impressions, including amphorae, roof tiles, bricks, lamps, glass vessels, and terra sigillata (fine pottery). Textiles and bread were also sometimes stamped, and stamps like Harvard’s may have been used for such a purpose (3). Roof tiles and bricks were being stamped in Greece as early as the Archaic period. In the West, the earliest evidence for stamps comes from amphorae dated from the end of the fourth to the beginning of the third centuries BCE (4).   The texts of stamps most often refer to the name of the producer or manufacturer of the product in the genitive case (e.g., 1978.495.34 “of Cossinus Eutychianus”). In certain instances, the name is written using ligatures or abbreviations. Other stamps include an image such as a leaf (hedera) or an abstract pattern, while some stamps have writing in what seems to be an imitation of alphabetic characters, although it is clearly not Latin or Greek (5). In these cases, where the recipients of such goods were most likely illiterate, the presence of a stamp on the object may have sufficed to guarantee a certain level of quality. Stamps could have varying degrees of decoration along the border and may or may not have a horizontal element to divide separate lines of text (6). The extent a stamp was used varied according to workshop; certain workshops continued to use their stamps until the writing was no longer legible before replacing them (7).   NOTES:   1. G.

303999,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This three-finned, large bronze projectile point was cast in a three-part mold. The casting seams are visible behind the barbs of each fin. There are casting flaws along the central socket. The tip is blunted, as if from impact; the edge of each fin is sharp. The individual fins end in a sharp undercut barb, which also has a tapered sharpened edge. One side bears a cast inscription in relief (ΦΙΛΙΠΠΟ) with Greek letters in retrograde, reading “of Philip” (1). This projectile point probably fit onto the wooden shaft of a large thrust or fired missile. It appears to be too large to fire from a conventional bow. One suspects that it was intended to be fired from a small crossbow or catapult-like device (2). Its reported findspot “near the city of Olynthos” and the presence of the inscription indicate that it was probably used during the siege of Olynthos by Philip II of Macedon in 348 BCE. Similar inscriptions are also found on Late Classical and Hellenistic sling bullets. The sentiment on this missile tip resembles the messages chalked on highly explosive 500-pound bombs dropped during World War II, which read, “Take that, Adolf.” This and other projectile heads in the Thessaloniki and Polygyros museums supposedly come from the Ritsos collection.

304002,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Supporting an amphora on his left shoulder, this statuette of a youth stands on a flat, circular base that may have adorned a candelabrum. His left hand grips one handle of the vase, which is balanced on top of his shoulder, while his right hand rests on his waist. His carefully incised hair, with straight bangs cut away over the ears and a triple-lined headband circling the crown of the head, is remarkable for both the unusually fine state of its preservation and the lack of variation in its styling. This feature contrasts, too, with the crudeness of the modeling of the youth’s hands, feet, and facial features.    The figure is, at first glance, enigmatic. It features several elements that belong stylistically to a range of artistic periods within the Etruscan era, making it difficult to place chronologically. Although this type of eclecticism is not unknown in Etruscan art, the eclectic style of this figure is questionable, especially in combination with its unconvincing patina and unusual metal alloy.   The inspiration for the piece is another copper alloy figure, an Ethiopian water carrier from an Etruscan necropolis dated to the fourth century BCE in the Museo Nazionale Etrusco Pompeo Aria, Marzabotto (1). The Marzabotto piece is identical in most every feature to the Harvard piece except for the head and face, which are African in character. Although the two figures differ slightly in height (the Marzabotto piece is 11.89 cm, slightly taller than the Harvard one), the basic proportions, weight-bearing stance, modeling of hands, feet, etc., are nearly identical. Such resemblances are too marked to be considered accidental. The conundrum that remains is whether a cast was made of the Marzabotto water carrier, from which a new piece was created, or, if in fact, the forger had copied the piece without the benefit of a mold.    Water carriers are associated with the symposium, and thus they are an appropriate theme for the adornment of candelabra bases (2). However, while this is the function given for the Marzabotto figure, it is highly unlikely that the Harvard piece was made for this purpose, since it seems to have been cast separately from a candelabrum. Another piece of the same date from Marzabotto, that of a warrior and a woman (3), also provided inspiration for the forger; a copy of the warrior from the pair is also in Harvard’s collection (4). Both the warrior and the youth have several characteristics in common that give them a “family resemblance,” such as almond-shaped eyes and brows, mouths with the same deep lines dividing upper and lower lips into an Archaic smile, and crudely carved hands with deep grooves denoting the spaces between the fingers. Additionally, the feet of both figures have a “spade” shape, their thighs and calves follow a similar line in their curvature (as well as in the negative space between the legs), and their chins give the impression of being slightly double, as if the face of the warrior provided the inspiration for the water carrier’s. The hand of a single forger can be detected in both pieces.   NOTES:   1. Inv. no. B 386. See G.

The handle is broken off horizontally just above the female head. The back of the attachment is concave, and the base of the handle is recessed.   The woman’s face is oval, dominated by large eyes framed by curving eyelids and larger eyebrows. Her small nose sits high between the eyes. Her mouth curves downward farther at the proper right side than the proper left. Three curving waves of hair, arranged symmetrically on her forehead, project in relief from beneath her hair band. At the base of her neck, the upper hem of a garment is incised with tiny vertical grooves.    The massive squarish Gorgon face has huge oval eyes, framed by relief eyelids and larger ridge-like eyebrows. A triangular nose with parallel, incised wrinkles extends upward to the bridge of the nose. The grinning mouth displays well-modeled teeth, a protruding tongue, and overlapping pairs of canines. Above each ear, a stumpy horn projects diagonally outward on either side of a row of spirals representing hair or a snake. A large relief spiral or volute, the upper end of which is smooth, projects on the proper left side of the gorgoneion. There is no corresponding spiral on the proper right side. A close parallel is the female head at the base of the vertical handle of a fragmentary bronze hydria in Mainz, identified by its inscription as a dedication by Telesstas (1). A closely similar vertical handle with a kore protome is in Olympia (2). The gorgoneion belongs to a group of horned Gorgons (3), but the juxtaposition of a female bust and a gorgoneion is unique. The curling spiral at one side suggests that the handle was originally intended to be cast with two reclining animals, perhaps rams, projecting outward to serve as side brackets with which to secure the handle to the vessel, in a fashion similar to an intact hydria handle at Harvard (4). The unfinished state of the outer side of the handle and the break at the top suggest that the casting of this handle was unsuccessful.   The attribution of this remarkable fragment to a Lakonian workshop seems certain. Its date was originally placed around 550 BCE, despite the almost “Daedalic”-looking curls of the woman’s head. However, C. Stibbe has recently pushed its date back to the first quarter of the sixth century BCE.   NOTES:   1. W.

The end of the scraper that is closer to the handle is raised (as is that of 1978.495.54). The underside of this cupped area is defined by two stepped curves that gradually recede into the surface as inset lines and disappear before the curve in the scraper blade (1). The broad and flat upper surface of the handle is stamped in the metal with two rosettes. Between these rosettes lies an elongated rectangular mark, which also appears to have been stamped in the metal and contains raised letters that are no longer legible in the corroded surface, although x-radiography revealed a stamped maker’s mark reading “SWTEIRA.” The finial at the ends of the handles on 1983.7 and 1960.484 are decorated with two cut-out mirroring kidney-shaped holes that have been enhanced with small punched lines at the height of the indentation.   A strigil, which consists of a curved scoop with a handle, was a tool used in the baths for cleaning an individual’s body. Oil would be applied to a person’s skin and then removed, along with dirt or sweat, using the curved scoop of a strigil (2). The Apoxyomenos statue type, known from ancient literature as well as several copies including two over-life-size bronze versions, depicts an athlete cleaning the scoop of a strigil after use (3).

304008,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The short kilt with rounded edges and rectangular tab hanging between the legs is the only indication that this leonine deity is male. The well-sculpted bare torso displays an elaborate, four-banded broad collar. Gold leaf inlay ornaments the eyes, and a single, large rearing cobra crowns the lion head. The long, elongated feline face has a narrow, almost humanoid, nose. The whiskers on the rounded muzzle are represented by an abstract petal-like pattern. The god holds both of his hands clenched with holes through them, indicating the original placement of attributes. The proper left fist is positioned vertically and attached to the leg by a short strut, while the right rests horizontally across the knee. Overall, this statue exhibits a sensitivity in the modeling of the human form, evident in the slight swelling of the belly, the slender arms and legs, and the individually detailed toes. The boxlike footrest is attached to the throne by a thin strip of bronze, now broken. Faint incisions mark the edges and sides of the throne, but the designs are no longer visible to the naked eye. It is possible to make out what appears to be a falcon between lotus buds, which is similar to the depiction on the throne sides of 1943.1121.B.   The two magnificent statues of enthroned lion-headed deities represent Late Period Egyptian bronze working at its finest. They may belong to Dynasty 26 (c. 664-525 BCE) based on comparisons with dated examples (1). The two figures depict a female deity (1943.1121.B) and a more rarely found male deity (1943.1121.A); they do not, however, constitute a matched pair, as the workmanship and stylistic features distinguish them as products of different artists. A study of similar bronzes in the Berlin museum revealed that they were often used as containers for sacrificed ichneumons, although the Harvard examples are empty (2). The ichneumon, as the hunter of dangerous serpents with which the lioness goddesses are connected, transforms the potentially destructive nature of the divinity into a tamed protector.   The lion (or more accurately lioness) head is the most common animal head for female deities and it is associated with several different ones. In the absence of an inscription, it can be difficult to determine which goddess is represented. In the New Kingdom, one goddess who was represented in large stone sculptures of lion-headed goddesses was Sakhmet, whose name literally means “She who is Powerful.” Similarly forceful goddesses assume the leonine attributes, including Matit (“She who Dismembers”), Mehit (“She who Seizes”), and Pakhet (“She who Scratches”) (3). Inscriptions on Late Period lion-headed bronzes most commonly name the goddess Wadjet, associated with the Delta site of Buto, as is the case with 1943.1121.B. As the regional goddess of Lower Egypt, she appears in the form of a fire-spiting serpent and was paired with Nekhbet, the vulture-goddess of Upper Egypt. Together they appear as protomes on royal headdresses, Wadjet taking the form of the cobra-head (known to us through the Greek name, uraeus). Wadjet also encompasses a solar aspect and, along with Sakhmet, is equated with the fiery eye of Re, hence the common occurrence of the solar disc in the iconography of lion goddesses. There is also evidence that the destructive qualities of these goddesses were softened by their syncretism with more benign goddesses such as Bastet, Hathor, and Mut. A bronze seated lion-headed goddess in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, that is quite close iconographically to 1943.1121.B, is inscribed with a prayer to Mut (4).   Most feline deities are female, and the depiction of lion-headed male deities is unusual. The identification of 1943.1121.A as male is based on the fact that the deity wears a short kilt instead of the tight-fitting long dress (5). The leonine heads are not differentiated between the male and female, since both have a slightly flaring mane that surrounds the face and a long tripartite wig, which conceals the junction between animal and human forms. Inscribed examples of male lion-headed deity statuettes are much less common than inscribed female examples; Roeder notes one example with a prayer to Horus, Son of Wadjet in Berlin (6). A second piece inscribed with epithets of Horus is in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem (7). Such inscriptions, however, may also be associated with Wadjet, as is the case for Harvard’s female deity 1943.1121.B. In addition, the lion-headed gods can be connected with Shu, the son of the creator-god Atum and brother of Tefnut. The brother-sister couple, who began the sexual cycle of reproduction through their mating, were identified with the lion and worshipped at Leontopolis (Tell Muqdam in the Delta). Also worshipped in leonine form at Leontopolis was Mahes (Greek: Miysis or Mios), a war god and guardian of sacred places (8). A Greek commentary mentions sacred enclosures and catacombs for mummified lions at this site, but no archaeological finds have confirmed this practice (9).    NOTES:   1. See, for example, B. V.

304009,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This spear-butt or sauroter consists of a tapering four-sided point that rises from a cylindrical socket. The juncture between the socket and the point has a torus-shaped molding flanked by a minute fillet on either side. The sauroter was attached to the spear shaft to allow the spear shaft to be rammed into the ground so that it could be held fast by the warrior wielding it against the onrush of the enemy. If the shaft of the spear were broken, the sauroter could also be used as an effective weapon in its own right. Very close parallels for this sauroter were found at Olympia (1).   The socket itself consists of a plain band at the shaft end of the object, from which spring ten tapering facets that articulate the socket shaft. The point rises out of four inset corners, each one with a central carination that rises to the edge formed by the intersection of two sides of the point. At the rear edge of each side, slightly concave facets taper toward each other, meeting in a point connected with the torus molding by a short carination.    An inscription of twelve letters, reading from left to right, is incised along the bottom of the point near its tip. It reads ΤΩΝ ΟΛΥΝΘΟΘΕΝ (of the Olynthians). The two thetas consist of a circle with a central dot. If genuine, the inscription would indicate that the object had formed part of a dedication of weapons, perhaps part of a trophy, erected at a sanctuary. This could have been at Olympia, or, more likely, a costly object dedicated at a Macedonian sanctuary center such as Dion. The condition is excellent, except for two scrapes on the opposite side from the inscription.    NOTES:   1. See H.

304011,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The lioness deity, identified by an inscription as Wadjet, wears an ankle-length sheath typical of this class of bronzes. The upper part merges completely with the form of her torso, so that it appears as if her upper body is unclothed. Her crown is a composite of two tall feathers fronted by a sun disc cradled between two cow horns, the entirety of which was set on top of a modius with a large flaring uraeus at the front. Such headdresses are associated with the nurturing goddess Hathor, who is syncretized with the primeval lioness-goddess Tefnut. This example displays a rounded feline face with a short muzzle; the whiskers are indicated by thick, curving engravings. Her eyes are set deep within the face, with highly placed lids. The eyes may have originally been inlaid, as on 1943.1121.A, but the inlay has been lost. Her legs display a thin, flat profile with a sharply angled bend at the knees that differs from the rounded execution of the male deity’s legs. She holds her proper right hand open and palm down above her knee; her left hand, attached to the leg by a small strut, retains its clenched fist which probably originally held a separately worked scepter.   Wadjet sits on a richly decorated throne. A hieroglyphic inscription, which begins on the proper right side of the throne with the sign for Horus (a falcon) and continues in the upper left corner on the back, reads “Horus, the great god, Beḥdetite”  (1). As the Beḥdetite, Horus is represented in the form of a hovering falcon or winged solar disc who protects the individual king and is closely related to the renewal of kingship (2). The inscription naming the goddess Wadjet appears in the upper right hand corner of the proper left side of the throne. The back panel is divided into two rectangular zones. The upper zone, which occupies the slightly protruding ledge of the throne back, depicts the Horus-falcon with outstretched wings. It grasps the shen rings of eternity and feathers of maat (cosmic order) in its claws and wears a sun disc as a headdress. Below this scene, a lion-headed figure, perhaps male, wearing a large disc on its head is shown kneeling in profile to the right. Extending both arms, it holds the sides of an enclosing arch and appears to balance upon a diamond-shaped element, which may be the central element of the heb “festival” basket glyph. The arch, which is rendered by a single line with a parallel row of stippled dots along the outside, may be an abstraction of two notched palm branches, symbols of one hundred thousand years of reign. The two throne sides show similar imagery: that on the proper right depicts a lion-headed figure wearing the Double Crown, while on the left side a lion-headed figure carries a large disc on its head. In both, the figure squats on an open lotus flower from which seven smaller tendrils extend. The entire scene surmounts a geometric design representative of the niches and buttresses of palace facades.

An irregular hole, perhaps an area of damage, punctures the bottom of the long neck.   The back of this head is undecorated and concave.

It is unclear whether this object would have been part of a composite work or intended as a freestanding, suspended, or mounted image.   The Harvard head has no immediate parallels.

The register line and inside border of the frame are embellished with herringbone hatching. The back of the object is plain.    In typical Luristan style, both registers feature Master of Animals figures flanked by open-mouth lionesses with bound waists and curled tails resting upon their backs. The figures have round heads that are indented at the crown, hair coils on either side of their faces, large eyes, long noses, and small mouths. They have bare torsos and wear short, belted skirts, which suggest that they are male. Their arms are extended and, based on the distance between their skirt hems and their toes, they seem to be portrayed seated or crouching.    The upper register depicts three figures. The outer figures are poised atop the backs of the lionesses in profile, flanking the third and largest figure, who sits atop a rosette. The figures are linked at their hands and hair curls, and the lionesses’ jaws touch the skirt of the central figure. In the lower register, a single figure is situated between the felines. His hands rest upon their forelegs, keeping them at bay, and the felines’ jaws gape on either side of his head.

The head is elongated, and its upright animal ears rise from a bulge extending to both sides of the chin. The exterior surfaces of the ears are concave. A crack extends from the front edge of the left ear. A vertical crack appears in the surface of the neck below the chin. The hollow eyes, marked by raised brows, originally had inlaid pupils, perhaps of glass paste. A knob ending in a biconical bead with a second conical element on top rises from the center of the forehead. The socket is emphasized by a group of three raised ridges. There is no incised surface ornament anywhere on this protome.   Square-socketed griffin protomes are rare. A virtual twin to this protome is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2). The date of acquisition of both pieces suggests that they may originally have formed a pair. While other griffin protomes ending in square sockets are known from Etruscan contexts, they differ markedly from the Harvard piece (3). Their necks are thin and stylized, and pairs of paws extend from the front part of the body (4). Possible uses for these protomes are for the arms of elaborate chairs or thrones, for the ends of horizontal poles, for sedan chairs, or as attachments for braziers. The modeling of the head, ears, and forehead knob make it highly probably that this piece is based on examples from an eastern Greek workshop that was closely affiliated with the workshop at the Heraion of Samos, to which around 300 griffin protomes are fragments have been attributed (5).

The slightly tapering shaft is decorated with a globe and a smaller, biconical bead. The square-sectioned shaft develops rounded edges at the tapering end, which is bent. Possible engraved decoration or other details are obscured by heavy corrosion. The bending may well be ancient, since this object is said to be from the Argive Heraeum, where comparable pins were found in a twisted condition (1). This pin fragment could have been acquired by the donor on a trip to Greece in 1892, when the American excavations at the Argive Heraeum had just started and may have drawn travelers to this site.   Pins of the Geometric period are well known from finds in graves and sanctuaries, especially those of female deities. They consist of a disc head with finial, a shaft that may be partly square in section and often bears incised decoration, and one or more globes or biconical beads on the upper part of the shaft. The beads may be framed by simple or multiple ring moldings. Because of its size, this example would have been classified as a “spit” rather than a “pin” by the excavators of the Heraeum. From a typological point of view, however, such objects are pins, albeit too large and heavy for actual use on a dress. Dedicated in sanctuaries and placed in graves, their display value as objects containing a substantial amount of metal outweighed practical considerations (2). It has even been suggested that the pins of the Geometric period may have been a primitive type of currency, like heavy rings such as 1895.202.A, 1895.202.C, 1920.44.219, and 1977.216.2123.13 (3).

304017,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The ram’s head is finely modeled, with curling horns whose projecting tips are placed in front of the ears, which also project outward. The horns are marked by faint diagonal grooves on the outer sides and the tops. The ram’s fleece consists of regular spiral curls modeled in relief, with each curl spiraling counterclockwise. Three rows of curls occur on the underside of the head between the horns. A modeled or incised line curves in front of the tips of the horns. The underside of the ram’s head is flat. The bridge of its nose, extending from the front row of curls to the nostrils, is convex in profile and deeply rounded. The modeling of the cheekbones consists of a convex triangular ridge that extends from underneath the eye to just behind the nostrils on both sides of the head. The eyes are oval, with pronounced eyelids and eyebrows. The mouth and nostrils are outlined by deep grooves. The nostrils extend diagonally backward from the tip of the muzzle. Two lateral, parallel grooves extend across the front edge of the bridge of the nose. The ram’s head is solid with a shallow circular depression at the back, which may have been served as a socket for the insertion of a cylindrical handle.    This head’s fine modeling in relief, almost all rendered in the wax model, makes it highly likely that this object was cast in the second half of the fifth or the first half of the fourth century BCE. It seems likely that this ram’s head served as the terminal for the handle of a shallow basin or patera intended for washing hands, usually used with a trefoil oinochoe. This type of handled patera, usually made of bronze, persists for centuries, extending well into the middle Roman Imperial Period (1).    NOTES:   1. D.

304018,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This fragmentary bust weight depicts an emperor wearing a laurel-wreath crown and a breastplate, both of which are marked with a rosette. The head, neck, and part of the shoulder and chest are preserved. The proper right shoulder was formerly in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, and was given to Harvard in 1972. The scaled breastplate (lorica squamata), is bordered around the neck by a rope-like band. On the preserved shoulder, there is a wavy fillet that has descended from the crown and would have been mirrored by another fillet on the left shoulder (the first loop of the fillet is preserved above the break). A baldric strap runs vertically over the shoulder, with a beaded border on each side and a row of dots in the center possibly to represent stitching and perforations for fastening that would have appeared on a real leather baldric.   The facial features are large and well preserved, although they do not precisely correspond to known imperial portrait types. The emperor’s hair is rendered in thick locks, with individual strands indicated and a pinwheel shape on the back of the head; the coiffure is markedly different from that of 2012.1.97, a second emperor bust weight in Harvard’s collection. Although this bust has often been identified as a Julio-Claudian emperor (1) based on hairstyle, it may be more likely that, like other imperial bust weights, it was meant to represent a generic imperial personage, while the hairstyle reflected what was popular at the time (2).   Steelyards were commonly used throughout the ancient Mediterranean. These crossbeams would have a weight, usually in the form of a person or deity, that slid along the bar of the scale to measure bulk goods (3). Not surprisingly, many of the Late Roman and Byzantine examples with known findspots have been found along a coast or in shipwrecks, reflecting their commercial utility. The standard term in English, “steelyard,” is a bit misleading, deriving from the use of similar scales in the area on the north bank of the Thames, London, where steel merchants clustered until 1597. In the Roman period, a wide range of figures was represented on the weights, reflecting the diversity of forms of Roman small bronzes in general. By the fourth to fifth century CE, this multiplicity had narrowed and almost all steelyards used weights represented a generic empress type (e.g., 2007.104.3.A-C) or the goddess Athena (Minerva) (4). Although many late examples have been dated generally to the Late Roman period, the most firmly dated example is from the seventh-century shipwreck of Yassi Ada, off the coast of modern Turkey (5). The holdings of the Harvard Art Museums represent the lively eclecticism of this category of bronze, including busts of an empress type, a Minerva, an emperor and an ambiguous nude.   The basic shape of the bust weights was probably created from the lost-wax process, with later refinements added as the materials cooled. The hollow core was filled with lead to achieve the required weight, and a thin bronze sheet on the bottom capped the lead filling. Variations appear in the manufacture of different categories of the weights. The upper loop, with which the figure would be attached to the upper scale, was aligned in two different directions: the loop on the empress bust weights ran front-to-back, while the Minerva bust weights, in contrast, had a top loop that presents its circular face to the viewer. Furthermore, the Minerva weights possess rectangular socles, and the empress weights have oval socles.   NOTES:   1. Although, Germanicus, nephew and one-time heir of Tiberius, has also been singled out for having a similar hairstyle; see U. W.

In this example, the four crossbars were threaded through holes in the frame and prevented from falling out by twisting the ends in opposite directions (2).    The instrument played an important part in the rites of the goddesses such as Hathor and Isis. It is often depicted as insignia of young female participants of these cults. With the spread of the Isis cult, examples of sistra have been found throughout the Roman world, including Pompeii (3). Many examples incorporate the head of Hathor along with other ornaments, although this sistrum is unadorned. The frame of the sistrum is roughly rectangular with an elegant triangular pediment. It represents the naos, or shrine, of the goddess. The handle tapers from an oval cross section down to a round one at the bottom and is terminated by a conical finial, perhaps a simplification of the papyrus column. Three of the four crossbars survive, one of which is broken and no longer secured within the frame.    NOTES:   1. Thanks are due to E. Russo, Brown University, for this information.   2.

The details of the face are unclear, but the figure has protruding almond-shaped eyes, a prominent and pointed chin, and a small, short nose that is rather high on her face. Her body is flat below the neck, with smooth, sloping shoulders. The figure appears to wear a long, seamless cloak, with sleeves ending at approximately the figure’s elbow, and the hem falling to above the figure’s pointed shoes. There are no internal details on the cloak, front or back, although some indications of shape of the body under the cloak around the arms, shoulders, and lower body are visible on the back. The figure’s hands are free of the cloak and separated from the body. The right hand is raised up and bent backward; the left hand, unnaturally long, is held low with palm out and arching toward the body.

His eyes are deeply inset; his nose is prominent and his mouth is a small horizontal gash within the beard. He may be nude, with a triangular shape at the base of his torso representing genitalia. He stands with his weight on his left foot and his right knee slightly bent. The heel of his right foot is prominent, making it appear as though he is wearing boots, but no other details of boots are depicted. His arms are spread and holding a small quadruped. He grips the hindquarters of the animal in his right hand and in his left he holds a vessel or sack, which is open and hollow.  His thumbs are molded, but the fingers are only slightly indicated. The animal has its forepaws balanced on the man’s torso. Some texturing on the animal is used to indicate wool or fur. A spur of metal (possibly an oddly shaped leg) connects the torso of the animal to the right shoulder of the man. Except for the backs of the lower legs, which are fully formed in the round, the back of the figure is unfinished. It is also concave at the back of the head and the back of the shoulders. The elbows stick out prominently in the back. In the center of his back are the remains of a square-sectioned peg (1.0 x 1.0 cm). The peg on the back indicates that this might have been an attachment or applique of some kind.

304023,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This disc is decorated with intricate incised and openwork geometric shapes over three distinct decorative zones. The outermost and simplest area on the disc is a wide plain band with several fine circular lines. Next, there is a ring of openwork and incised decoration with four quadrants: each quadrant consists of a semicircular triple row of small oblong cutouts, then a plain band, and then four L-shaped cutouts, followed by another plain band around the central medallion. The quadrants are divided by a double row of oblong cutouts with a single row of incised circles with interior dots on either side. At the center, a smaller wheel-shaped disc with triangular openwork cutouts and a serrated edge is attached to the larger disc by a rivet. The rivet has a domed head at one end (the exterior) and a loop at the other end (the interior)—the loop is turned after insertion into a slot on the larger disc in order to keep it in place. The interior has no incised decoration (1).   The use of discs such as this one is highly debated. Elaborately decorated bronze discs from seventh-century BCE Italy are well known from museum collections. The discs are generally of two sizes: discs of the small size, like this one, range from c. 10 to 12 cm in diameter; and those of the large size range from c. 20 to 25 cm in diameter. In the past, discs of both sizes have been considered to be elements of Italic armor, with the larger discs labeled as cardiophylaxes or pectorals (a small, round breastplate) (2). Recent research, however, suggests that both types of disc are elements of female dress (3). The discs would perhaps have been worn attached to a strip of cloth that wrapped around the neck and draped down the front, with the larger disc attached at the sternum and the smaller disc (like this one) attached at the bottom like a terminal. Supporting the new interpretation is the fact that, where findspots are known, most of these discs are found in female graves (4).   NOTES:   1. For similar discs, see G. Colonna, “Migranti Italici e ornato femminile (a proposito di Perugia e dei Sarsinati qui Perusiae consederant,” Ocnus 15 (2007): 89-116, esp. 108, no. A.5, figs. 4.5 and 5.2; and R.

Weidig notes that over half of the discs that had been called pectorals are more properly feminine decorative pieces and goes on to discuss and illustrate true versions Italic pectorals.   4. The interpretation of Italic bronze girdles closely parallels these discs. Originally thought to be elements of an Italic warrior’s panoply, in this case thought to act as a reinforced military belt, they are now understood to be part of female dress because almost all excavated examples come from the graves of women; see M.

NOTES:  1. For possible identification of the figures, see R. De Puma, _Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum. USA 2: Boston and Cambridge_ (Ames, IA, 1993) 61-63, no. 44. He notes that the club of the male figure may indicate that Paris is represented and that if three rather than two female figures were represented, then the scene could be identified as the Judgement of Paris. As there are only two female figures, this identification is uncertain.  2. Ibid., 62; and id. in _Antichità dall’Umbria a New York_, exh. cat., ed. L. Bonfante and F.

A rectangular hole pierces the transverse bar and plate.   The front of the plate and curving section are covered by extensive relief decoration that is unfortunately difficult to interpret. The plate has a raised rim around the edge, which is interrupted by the transverse bar. In the area above the bar is a Phrygian cap with horizontal rays or perhaps a half-shell behind it. The lower section has a man, seated with his legs to the left, head frontal, torso in three quarter view. He wears a cloak, clasped over the right shoulder, that leaves his torso bare; there is also some drapery across his left hip. On his head, he has perhaps a laurel crown or a turban. The facial features are worn and indistinct, but some musculature is clear on the arms, torso, and legs. He rests his left hand on a shield with a circular boss or a large patera on the ground. His right arm is upraised grasping a sword, staff, or standard. There are four other standard-like objects to the left of the figure and one to the right. Also to the right are what appear to be banners or sails. He may be sitting on a pile of arms. The thin curved section is pointed at the top, expanding and then tapering down to the transverse bar, where it ends in a slightly curving projection. It is decorated with vegetal patterns, including flowers, leaves, and berries on either side of an oval with a central four-petaled rosette. There is some additional decoration (of indeterminate pattern) on either end.  The transverse bar has a simple raised border at the top and bottom; it expands toward the center and then narrows. The flat end is decorated by a raised leaf or feather.

On 1920.44.248, the smallest of Harvard’s figurines in this series, the gender seems most decisively indicated by roundels for breasts and an inverted triangle for the vulva. The legs are rounded to a soft point.    The facial features of this type of votive offering have a relatively uniform style: punched roundels for eyes, a raised ridge formed by the angular modeling of the head for a nose, and a simple incised groove for a mouth. Gender can be difficult to determine, as both male and female figures are depicted with nipples; the difference may be that “breasts” tend to be indicated by larger, punched roundels. Genitalia for the females are often an inverted triangle, while for the males there is a nearly circular knob of bronze, although sometimes it is flattened, making identification difficult. These statuettes also have a common stance with arms outstretched to the sides and legs parted in a V-shape. The open positioning of the arms is generally interpreted as a pose of prayer, consistent with that of other types of votive offerings found in tombs and sanctuary deposits (1). The Umbrian examples of this type of votive are cast and file finished; 1,600 of them were found in a pit deposit at a mountain sanctuary at the top of Monte Acuto, Italy (2). A similar sanctuary context for the five figurines in the Harvard collection may also be assumed. Small, lightweight, and flattened in form, they would have been easy to produce and may have been made near cult shrines to catch the trade of visiting pilgrims.   NOTES:   1.

Its thin body narrows at the torso. Below its right fore hoof, there is a narrow spike for attachment to a base. The bull’s proper right leg is missing about half its length, and its right horn is broken off at the base. There are carved ridges on its neck.    The function of the broken protrusions behind the horns of 1920.44.259 is difficult to ascertain; bull figurine 1920.44.255 does not have similar projections. Although no surface detail remains on figure 1920.44.259, its schematic style is similar enough to 1920.44.255 to suggest a common origin.   Many varieties of votive animals are known, including horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, bulls, and oxen. The production of ox or bull figurines appears to have been a phenomenon among rural Etruscan workshops. The fact that the cast was filed by hand typically produced a schematized, flattened form, finished at the edge. The stylized forms have notches or grooves for the face and fur, punched circles for the eyes, and small marks for the tail. A schematic style among these workshops is evident in the separated limbs, triangular head, and projected ears, horns, and tails.    Animal figurines of the sixth to fourth centuries BCE were offered as part of fertility rituals to insure the health of livestock. The burial of these bronzes in sanctuary deposits points not only to their symbolic importance but also to the mass-production of these items.

While it may have stood on its own, it could also have been part of a larger votive tray comprising several different animals.    In Egypt, the frog symbolized fertility, reproductive success, and regeneration, making it a popular amulet form (1). Each year with the subsiding of the Nile flood, thousands of frogs reappeared, seemingly by magic, leading to the belief that they were self-generating (2).

304042,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The relatively large size of this seated Harpokrates suggests that is was produced as an independent piece rather than as part of an enthroned Isis group (1). The side-lock was made separately and mortised into a hole in the side of the head. Under a heavy layer of accretions, the fine workmanship of the piece defines a fully modeled, chubby youth with a well-rounded face and smooth skull. The presence of a broad collar can be deduced from the incised counterpoise that is visible on the back where the accretions are absent. It probably dates relatively early, to the seventh or sixth century BCE (2).    Harpokrates represents the god Horus as a child, shown nude with the side-lock of youth on the right side of his head and his right index finger to his mouth. As the son of Osiris and Isis, he gained immense popularity during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, during which time the production of bronze figurines of Harpokrates flourished. He often wears the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, a feature common in first millennium Egypt when youthful deities acquired kingly attributes. Another characteristic headdress is the nemes head cloth, although frequently the boy is depicted with either a shaven head or a tight-fitting skull cap. His nude body typically retains the roundness of flesh associated with young boys. The child-god could be represented seated, striding, or squatting. When seated, he assumes a semi-reclining position derived from that of a baby on its mother’s lap; many of the smaller examples of these figurines may originally have belonged with a seated Isis figure (3). Suspension loops for attachment as a pendant indicate an amuletic connection that may have been particularly associated with young children.    NOTES:   1.

Identifiable subjects include Hermes and Lasa on this mirror, as well as two young men wearing short chitons and Phrygian caps on 1932.56.37, who may be the Dioskouroi (1). The subjects depicted on other mirrors are more difficult to identify with certainty. One such example is a scene depicting two young men flanking two women, one of whom is nude, in front of an architectural structure (1977.216.1995.A-B); it has been suggested that the figures may be Helen, Clytemnestra, and the Dioskouroi (2). Another scene, less well preserved, shows a figure wearing a peplos and helmet flanked on the left by a man in a short tunic and boots, and on the right by an unidentified woman wearing a peplos and Phrygian cap (1977.216.2311). The central figure is most likely Athena (Etruscan Menrva), and while the figure on the left leans on a club similar to the one often carried by Herakles, it is unusual for that hero to be shown clothed (3). The three stand before a two-story Ionic structure.   Two mirrors in the collection show signs of an interesting afterlife. The disc of 1977.216.2311 has been perforated in ten places, probably as a means of ensuring that the object would be useless to the living and could be permanently dedicated to the deceased; a less plausible suggestion is that the mirror was reused as a strainer (4). Another mirror in the collection (1977.216.3422), if it is ancient, seems to have been reworked in modern times by an engraver who added to the medallion a female bust, a recumbent male, and an inscription. Neither the style nor the subject of the engraving corresponds to examples known from other Etruscan mirrors, and both the engraving and the inscription appear to have been made with a modern instrument (5).

The body is schematized and flattened. The hind legs are straight but broken, and the forelegs are missing. The bull stands with its head raised. Its horns are broken. The tail, connected to the body, hangs straight down. Behind the horns, two protrusions with broken ends appear on the bull’s neck.    The function of the broken protrusions behind the horns of 1920.44.259 is difficult to ascertain; bull figurine 1920.44.255 does not have similar projections. Although no surface detail remains on figure 1920.44.259, its schematic style is similar enough to 1920.44.255 to suggest a common origin.   Many varieties of votive animals are known, including horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, bulls, and oxen. The production of ox or bull figurines appears to have been a phenomenon among rural Etruscan workshops. The fact that the cast was filed by hand typically produced a schematized, flattened form, finished at the edge. The stylized forms have notches or grooves for the face and fur, punched circles for the eyes, and small marks for the tail. A schematic style among these workshops is evident in the separated limbs, triangular head, and projected ears, horns, and tails.    Animal figurines of the sixth to fourth centuries BCE were offered as part of fertility rituals to insure the health of livestock. The burial of these bronzes in sanctuary deposits points not only to their symbolic importance but also to the mass-production of these items. Umbrian sanctuaries have been a source of large deposits of these votive objects (1).         NOTES:   1. For examples from the Umbrian sanctuary of Monte Acuto, see L. Bonfante and F.

Its head turns forward and is modeled completely in the round. The tip of its nose is missing. Both forelegs are modeled as a single unit. The stump of the wing rises above the shoulder. There is a rounded cavity in the wing that may originally have contained an inlay of some substance contrasting with the surface of the bronze. The underside of this fragment is flat and slightly curved, conforming to the curvature of the larger object to which it was attached.    This winsome fragment originally belonged to a class of handles characterized by small horses or the protomes of horses, winged or wingless, on either side of a wide flat central handle, textured by concave cavetto flutes. Therefore, this fragment certainly had a counterpart at the other end of the handle to which it belonged. There are examples in Palermo (1), as well as on a plate with two similar handles attached now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2). The intact New York example demonstrates that such handles were attached to a flat pan or plate, rather than to a deeper dish or basin.    Although a winged horse is usually identified as Pegasos, the offspring of the beheaded Gorgon Medusa, winged horses also sometimes draw the chariots of the gods, as can be seen on a large painted “Melian” amphora of c. 650-620 BCE, in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens, where winged horses pull Apollo’s chariot (3). While this handle may have been made in Corinth, other workshops on mainland Greece and the Greek west remain viable candidates for its place of manufacture. It probably dates between 530 and 500 BCE.   NOTES:   1. See C. A. Di Stefano, Bronzetti figurati del Museo nazionale di Palermo (Rome, 1975) 97-98, nos. 175-76, pl. 38.   2.

It is unclear how the coiling was achieved. Each bracelet was presumably cast in a single long rod and then bent into coils by annealing. The coils are flat on the interior, with a triangular ridge in the center of the exterior. The terminals consist of a biconical bead, from which extends a short grooved cylindrical element that terminates in a conical projection. The bracelets are heavily corroded, with some sections missing along the edges. 1920.44.220 is missing one terminal.

They are, however, too small for an entire animal to be held, and no remains have been discovered in them. It is possible that only the head would have been enshrined. The snake figurine most commonly takes a figure-eight pose with its head resting opposite from its tail, as in 1920.44.287 (2). The head and body markings are rendered by incised lines. This example also has two opposing loops for suspension on the corners of the container. An inscription engraved in two registers on front of the container reads, “Atum give life to X-Osiris, son of Psamtik” (3). The name Psamtik occurs in Dynasty 26, placing this work among the earliest of the Egyptian bronzes in the collection. The god Atum, the creator god of Heliopolis, is associated with serpents (4), and the small bronze may have served an amuletic or votive (5). The protective function of these snake figurines is highlighted in the second Harvard piece, 1920.44.305, where the flared hood of the rearing snake figure signals its venomous nature. A diagonal strut supports the raised head. One suspension loop is preserved on the front right corner.   NOTES:   1. G.

This type is first seen in ivories, wall paintings, and engraved gems of the Aegean mainland in the Late Bronze Age. It then migrates to the Near East, returning to the Greek repertoire during the seventh century BCE and later as a motif in the Orientalizing period. Female sphinxes, dangerous and unpredictable, are especially prominent as guardians of graves (2). The best-known sphinx in Greek mythology is the Theban sphinx who killed any passersby unable to answer her riddle, which was finally solved by Oedipus.   This small sphinx betrays its Egyptian inspiration in its repose and the massive forms of its head and body. It probably belongs to a group of zoomorphic bronze weights that turn up in sites and on shipwrecks all along the eastern Mediterranean littoral. Particularly close is a sphinx weight recovered from the Ulu Burun shipwreck off the southern coast of Turkey dating to c. 1300 BCE (3). However, the style of the Ulu Burun sphinx weight differs from that of the Harvard sphinx (4). G. M. A. Hanfmann’s date of c. 700 BCE is probably accurate. The weight itself appears to have North Syrian characteristics and recalls unfinished basalt sculptures from the quarry site at Yesemek. This sphinx, then, belongs to a long tradition of zoomorphic weights in the Eastern Mediterranean and adjacent Near Eastern cultures that probably begins in the early second millennium BCE and extends into the North Syrian and Neo-Assyrian Iron Age. However, it could well be much earlier and have been handed down for many years.   NOTES:   1. For Greek sphinxes and their Near Eastern antecedents, see J. M.

304068,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The woman, rendered simply and stylistically, stands frontally,  holding out a patera in her right hand and uncertain offerings in her left. The facial features are simple, with circular eyes, round cheeks, and a broad, flat nose; the lower half of her face is chipped off. Her hear is pulled back into a round bun. Some of her hair is visible in the front under her peaked crown or headdress. She wears a short-sleeved  tunic (chiton), belted high under the bust, and a mantle (himation) draped around her waist, pulled up over her left shoulder, and tucked under her arm. In her outstretched right arm, she holds out a disc with a design in the center, representing a patera. Her left arm is represented as held in close to the body and covered by the mantle, with only the hand visible, bearing a pyxis or some other type of offering. Her left knee seems to be represented as slightly bent, and her shoes are partially visible coming out from under the front of the garment. At the bottom is a roughly square tang, as thick as the figurine, presumably used to secure it to a mount. The figurine is flat, but details of the hair and drapery are modeled on the back.   Figurines of this type are sometimes described as priestesses (1). Although the exact role of the woman is unclear, she is engaging in some type of religious activity, probably offering a libation from the patera in her hand. In a variation, these figurines often have their mantles pulled over the backs of their heads to indicate that they are involved in a ritual (2). Where findspots are known, these figurines come from sanctuaries (3).   NOTES:   1. There are a range of similar figures in D. K.

304069,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This three-handled water jar, or hydria, is of the kalpis type, which has a continuous curving profile and originated c. 500 BCE, perhaps in Athens. The body was hammered out of a single sheet of bronze to which the cast portions—three handles, the foot, and the rim—were joined with solder. The surface of the vessel is largely a greenish gold, which is reminiscent of its original color, although there are extensive areas of a darker greenish gray.    The rim (15.7 cm in diameter) features an overhanging band of egg-and-dart molding. Each egg is surrounded by a single raised ridge. Tiny beads encircle the outside of the flattened rim. The foot (15.5 cm in diameter) displays a concave band of tongues, in between each of which is a narrower convex tongue.    The side handles, decorated with four concave flutes with rounded ends, rise from circular plates decorated with concave tongues. The vertical handle, circular in section, bears five flutes separated by narrow ridges divided by fine grooves. The top rises from a base plate situated beneath the rim, identical with the plates of the side handles.    The base plate is a siren, whose sickle-shaped wings rise up out of her torso and curve inward symmetrically on either side of her head. Each individual feather, rendered in relief, has a fine incised median line, on either side of which are tiny incisions. The siren’s body is also covered with finely incised scales, which have a median line flanked by tiny incisions. The siren’s feet, each bearing three claws, hang vertically from raised edges below the scales and grasp an oval object, from which a seven-petalled palmette, with concave leaves, projects downward.    Above the palmette are two antithetical, concave S-shaped volutes, the smaller ends of which curl under the siren’s wings. The spaces between the volutes, the wings, and the tendrils are left open. The volutes’ centers are filled with small hemispherical oculi, which may be silver (1). Two curls descend in relief, curving symmetrically over the shoulders of the siren.    This hydria belongs to a class of vessels with sirens adorning the base plate of the vertical handles (2). They begin c. 480 BCE and continue throughout the rest of the fifth century, perhaps even into the first quarter of the fourth century. The shape of the Harvard hydria suggests that it dates between 430 and 400 BCE. The only intact Greek bronze vessel in the Harvard Art Museums' collection, this vase was used to carry and pour water, as the name hydria implies. Its funerary significance may be inferred from the presence of the siren at the base of this handle. Such expensive metal vases were given as prizes in athletic contests and often later contained the cremated ashes of their owners. Such use probably explains the unusually fine state of preservation of this hydria. Harvard's hydria represents the highest quality of late Classical Greek metalwork.   NOTES:   1.

The spine of the bow is decorated by a 2-cm wide section consisting of six rows of herringbone pattern bordered at the top and the bottom by three raised bands. Many areas throughout the decoration bear rows of very fine dots (pointillé). The underside is undecorated. Only the bow and catchplate are preserved; the spring and pin are lost.

304071,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This spectacle fibula consists of two large, slightly conical, spiral discs attached to a catchplate and pin. The catchplate is a long thin bar (11 cm x 7.5 cm) that is rectangular in section. A rivet through the center of each spiral connects to the catchplate, which tapers toward each end. On one end, the catchplate curves upward to form the pin, which is currently missing, while on the other, it tapers into a raised, hooked wire to hold the pin (1). The spirals (each 6.1 cm in diameter) are formed from a single piece of circular-sectioned wire that tapers in diameter from the center of the wire to the ends. The brooch would be formed by beginning in the center of one spiral and working outward, then creating the figure-8 that separates the two sides, then forming the second spiral from the outside in.   These fibulae (1952.15, 1952.112, and 1986.516) represent the miniature and monumental ends of the scale of this type of symmetrical fibula, which was commonly termed a “spectacle fibula.” Each was fashioned from a single thin bronze wire, square in section, which was annealed and turned in order to create the symmetrical spiral patterns and the springy elasticity needed to close them. One sharpened end of this wire, forming the pin proper, fits into the other end, which turns up to form a catchplate. Spectacle fibulae were widely distributed throughout the Balkans and northern Greece during the eighth century BCE (2). Excavations of rich burials in the Iron Age tumuli of Vergina and elsewhere have shown that these fibulae occur in pairs, placed over the shoulders of skeletons (3). They also served as dedications in sanctuaries throughout northern and central Greece and the Peloponnesus (4). Thus, they seem to have served to connect the front and back halves of garments at the shoulders of the wearers. It would be interesting to discover whether the presence of pairs of spectacle fibulae in graves is an indicator of female burials, or if both sexes wore two. They also served as dedications.

304072,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The moon god Mên holds his right arm out, clutching a pinecone. He wears a Phrygian cap over his wavy hair. The long cap, which ends in a point at the back, is decorated with incised lines and dots that may be a stylized representation of foliage. The border of the cap bears diagonal marks, possibly meant to represent a lining. Mên is depicted as a beardless youth. His eyes are deep-set in his oval face, and his mouth appears to be open. The points of the crescent moon seem to emerge from his shoulders; the rest of the crescent is not visible in the back. He wears a long, heavy cloak that covers his back with some horizontal and vertical marks to represent the drapery. The cloak comes over his shoulders, leaving his arms exposed, and is clasped at his breast with two raised spheres. Under the cloak, he wears a short, long-sleeved tunic, which is loosely draped above the belt. Below the curving horizontal line indicating the belt, the lower part of his garment falls in regular, vertical pleats to his knees. The ends of his sleeves are visible at the wrists (1). His extant hand, rendered with lines to indicate joints of the fingers and even fingernails, clutches a pine coin that is covered with hatchmarks. His left hand may have held a dish or other attribute. He stands frontally with his right leg locked. The knee is rendered and the top of a boot is visible before the break of the foot. The left knee is bent, with the foot moved back. The currently attached foot does not belong to this statuette. It wears a sandal that does not match the boot that the right foot would have worn (2).   Mên was a lunar deity worshipped in ancient Asia Minor (modern Turkey), who had a variety of roles, from god of healing to protector of tombs, and was also associated with fertility and the military (3). He is often shown with a crescent moon behind his shoulders and holding various attributes, sometimes a pinecone, although the precise meaning of this second attribute is not clear (4).   NOTES:   1.

The attenuated, perpendicular column of the young man’s neck supports his head, which is round and smooth. His nose and ears are shallowly modeled, and his eyes are impressed dots. However, his slit-like mouth is open and animated, and his chin, although subtly rendered, is clearly defined. His right hand, with all the fingers fully articulated, pulls against the right flank of the ram, steadying and straightening it forward. His effort in controlling the animal is expressed in the torsion of his shoulders, back, and hips, and by the uneven distribution of his weight; he leans forward on the bent left leg, with the straight right leg planted behind him. Both feet are planted flat on the squarish base, which is pierced by a rusted iron rod that extends upward into the ram’s belly. This is probably a remnant of the dowel that fastened the group to a larger object, perhaps a staff. The ram is thick and bulky, evoking its heavy wool and musculature, while its long, forward-curving horns enhance an impression of its strength. Its elongated, triangular face features a high nasal ridge extending from between the horns to the end of the muzzle. The ram’s mouth is open. The eyes and nostrils are indicated by precisely impressed or punched pits. The squat, stubby legs taper abruptly into the base that it shares with its human attendant.   It is instructive to compare this composition to three similar bronze figurine groups of a man with a ram from the Geometric period sanctuary of Delphi (1).

Aphrodite is nude except for a flowered diadem around her head; small holes in the center of the three rosettes may indicate that there were once inlays of another material in them. Her wavy hair, parted in the center, is pulled back into a bun at the nape of her neck, and there are also rolls of hair on the sides of her head. Her head is turned down and to the right, looking into the mirror, which is circular and has a long handle with a molded finial. Her face is naturalistically modeled: the eyes are indicated by circular punches, and the lobes of the ears appear under the rolls of hair on the sides of her head. Her arms are held away from the body but are bent at the elbows and raised. The fingers of both hands are very carefully modeled and separated, with the nails also rendered. Her body, rendered naturalistically with soft, round limbs, forms a strong S-curve. Her right hip juts out sharply, with her right leg locked and her left leg bent at the knee, foot pulled back, with only the toes in contact with the top of the base. Her thighs are pressed together and are joined in the metal down to the knees. The toes on both feet are clearly rendered but not separated. The statuette is modeled completely in the round.   The statuette was not originally paired with this base, and the bolt connecting them is modern. It has a simple bell-shape with sharply scooped sides, and it is hollow on the underside. Some simple moldings are rendered on the top and bottom. Brown corrosion on the top of the base may indicate where an ancient statuette may have originally attached to this base, if the base itself is ancient (1).   This statuette, which is identified as the goddess of love and beauty based on her nudity and accoutrements, represents the goddess at her toilet, as indicated by the mirror (2). It could be considered a variant of the type known as Aphrodite Pselioumene, after a sculpture by Praxiteles, but in this case, the goddess holds a mirror and apple instead of a necklace (3).

304076,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The length of wire is round in section at the springs and pin, while the bow and the portion leading to the catchplate are rectangular. There are parallel lines incised onto the spring closest to the catchplate. There is a small loss on the tip of the catchplate. The pin is broken 1 cm from the tip and has been reattached. The surface has green corrosion and thick burial accretions overall.            The serpentine fibula has an elegant form that consists of a single length of wire formed into a crescent-shaped fastener for clothing. One end of the wire has been sharpened into a point to puncture the cloth, while the opposite end has been shaped into a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin. Two single springs incorporated into the wire apply tension between the catchplate and pin. The section between the springs, called the bow, curves in harmony with the arch of the pin. There are nineteen serpentine fibulae in the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, and these fibulae have minor stylistic variations in form and decoration. They have no known provenience; however, serpentine fibulae were common during the Iron Age, and they are found distributed throughout Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and France (1).    The serpentine type of fibula is considered to have descended from the Late Bronze Age violin-bow type, which has a straight pin and a single spring. Replacing the violin-bow, the serpentine fibulae came into general use during the Early Iron Age, and the type continued to be used throughout the next half century. During this time, communities created their own types of fibulae, and discrete variations in the form developed. Trade in Italy during the eighth century BCE contributed to the spread of provincial styles; as a result, the traceability of their origins has been complicated. Serpentine fibulae were common in Sicily during Greek colonization, hence the type has also been termed “Sicilian” (2). Changes in the form have been used to date serpentine fibulae, the earliest of which have a flattened spiral catchplate. As the Iron Age progressed, the catchplate developed into a simple, folded channel, which became longer over time (3). 1987.135.53 and 1987.135.40 have the longest catchplates in the collection and probably date to the Late Iron Age, while the remaining fibulae with shorter catchplates are most likely from the Early Iron Age. Some of the fibulae in the Harvard collection have incised decorations, including 1987.135.38, which bears a herringbone pattern partially obscured by corrosion (4). Inscribed, consecutive parallel line patterns, similar to the ones on 1987.135.51, have been found on serpentine fibulae in central Italy (5).   NOTES:   1. Compare serpentine fibulae in J.

The surface of the wire has a slightly ribbed texture along the axis. There are round hammer marks on the catchplate. The pin is broken 2.5 cm from the catchplate. The surface has green corrosion and thick burial accretions overall.        The serpentine fibula has an elegant form that consists of a single length of wire formed into a crescent-shaped fastener for clothing. One end of the wire has been sharpened into a point to puncture the cloth, while the opposite end has been shaped into a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin. Two single springs incorporated into the wire apply tension between the catchplate and pin. The section between the springs, called the bow, curves in harmony with the arch of the pin. There are nineteen serpentine fibulae in the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, and these fibulae have minor stylistic variations in form and decoration. They have no known provenience; however, serpentine fibulae were common during the Iron Age, and they are found distributed throughout Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and France (1).    The serpentine type of fibula is considered to have descended from the Late Bronze Age violin-bow type, which has a straight pin and a single spring. Replacing the violin-bow, the serpentine fibulae came into general use during the Early Iron Age, and the type continued to be used throughout the next half century. During this time, communities created their own types of fibulae, and discrete variations in the form developed. Trade in Italy during the eighth century BCE contributed to the spread of provincial styles; as a result, the traceability of their origins has been complicated. Serpentine fibulae were common in Sicily during Greek colonization, hence the type has also been termed “Sicilian” (2). Changes in the form have been used to date serpentine fibulae, the earliest of which have a flattened spiral catchplate. As the Iron Age progressed, the catchplate developed into a simple, folded channel, which became longer over time (3). 1987.135.53 and 1987.135.40 have the longest catchplates in the collection and probably date to the Late Iron Age, while the remaining fibulae with shorter catchplates are most likely from the Early Iron Age. Some of the fibulae in the Harvard collection have incised decorations, including 1987.135.38, which bears a herringbone pattern partially obscured by corrosion (4). Inscribed, consecutive parallel line patterns, similar to the ones on 1987.135.51, have been found on serpentine fibulae in central Italy (5).    NOTES:   1. Compare serpentine fibulae in J.

There is a minor loss on the tip of the catchplate. The wire has minor bends and distortions along the pin. The surface has green corrosion and thick burial accretions overall.       The serpentine fibula has an elegant form that consists of a single length of wire formed into a crescent-shaped fastener for clothing. One end of the wire has been sharpened into a point to puncture the cloth, while the opposite end has been shaped into a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin. Two single springs incorporated into the wire apply tension between the catchplate and pin. The section between the springs, called the bow, curves in harmony with the arch of the pin. There are nineteen serpentine fibulae in the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, and these fibulae have minor stylistic variations in form and decoration. They have no known provenience; however, serpentine fibulae were common during the Iron Age, and they are found distributed throughout Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and France (1).    The serpentine type of fibula is considered to have descended from the Late Bronze Age violin-bow type, which has a straight pin and a single spring. Replacing the violin-bow, the serpentine fibulae came into general use during the Early Iron Age, and the type continued to be used throughout the next half century. During this time, communities created their own types of fibulae, and discrete variations in the form developed. Trade in Italy during the eighth century BCE contributed to the spread of provincial styles; as a result, the traceability of their origins has been complicated. Serpentine fibulae were common in Sicily during Greek colonization, hence the type has also been termed “Sicilian” (2). Changes in the form have been used to date serpentine fibulae, the earliest of which have a flattened spiral catchplate. As the Iron Age progressed, the catchplate developed into a simple, folded channel, which became longer over time (3). 1987.135.53 and 1987.135.40 have the longest catchplates in the collection and probably date to the Late Iron Age, while the remaining fibulae with shorter catchplates are most likely from the Early Iron Age. Some of the fibulae in the Harvard collection have incised decorations, including 1987.135.38, which bears a herringbone pattern partially obscured by corrosion (4). Inscribed, consecutive parallel line patterns, similar to the ones on 1987.135.51, have been found on serpentine fibulae in central Italy (5).   NOTES:   1. Compare serpentine fibulae in J.

The cast bow features three oblate beads; both sides of the central bead and the tops of the flanking beads are bordered by framing ridges. The catchplate has two oval extensions, each of which bears a small separately attached hemispherical bosses fastened by a rivet. The projection at the opposite end of the bow, from which the hinge of the pin projects, is marked by five tiny punched circles, each with a central pit. Three other similar punched circles extend vertically along the back of the catchplate between the two small bosses. The hinged pin appears to be intact. Although the use of a hinged pin rather than a coiled-spring pin is a late trait in Greek fibulae, the forms of the massive beads on the bow suggest that this is a sophisticated Late Archaic fibula, perhaps made between 530 and 480 BCE, somewhere in Macedonia or along the northern coast of the Aegean.

304096,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The two-handled basin stands on a splaying, bell-shaped foot. It is completely preserved except for some damage to the rim and two breaks in the thin, hammered walls. The foot, which is soldered to the bottom, has caused a slight bulge in the interior. The deep bowl curves inward before terminating in a flaring rim, which is decorated with an egg-and-dart molding on the exterior. The two horizontal handles bear three ring-moldings: a triple one in the apex and simpler ones on the sides. The handle attachments in the form of ivy leaves (“Herzblatt”) were cast in one piece with the handle and soldered onto the body of the basin. The vessel was finished on a lathe. A number of incised, lathe-turned lines surround the upper interior part of the rim, and a centering mark in the center of the bowl is surrounded by another line. Lathe-turned lines also decorate the cast foot.   Vessels of this type served as washbasins and were probably known as pelvis by the Romans (1). The shape can be traced back to ancient Greek basins. Examples of similar proportions with a high foot, contracted neck, and protruding rim belong to the late Hellenistic and early Imperial periods. The late Hellenistic basins with grape-leaf handle attachments have high, lathe-turned feet similar to the Harvard vessel, whereas the Augustan and early Imperial basins with hand-shaped attachments have a similarly thickened rim decorated with egg-and-dart (2). Ivy-leaf attachment plates are not otherwise attested on basins but occur on second- and first-century BCE situlae and jugs (3).   The Harvard basin was excavated in a cemetery of the Meroitic period in the Gammai plain of ancient Nubia, in the northern part of modern Sudan. The grave consisted of a shaft-like dromos and a chamber with a rich array of burial goods surrounding the skeleton of an adult male. These burial goods included pottery, bronze, and silver vessels as well as a silver signet ring worn by the deceased (4). The occurrence of other basins of related shapes in Nubia and Egypt may suggest a production center in Egypt (5), but the “Herzblatt” attachment of this basin points to the west. The presence of the basin and other imported bronze vessels in Grave 115 at Gammai attests the readiness of the local Nubian élite to adopt utensils of a Graeco-Roman origin.   NOTES:   1. W.

Crossbow fibulae were used in the Roman world from the third through sixth centuries CE (2). The distinctive fasteners, often decorated with prominent onion-shaped knobs, may have been status symbols, as indicated by examples in gold and the famous relief of the fourth-century Roman general Stilicho in Mantua, where crossbow fibulae are clearly rendered on the shoulders of the general and his son (3).

Its arched cast body has three globular forms, the central being larger than the other two. All three forms have circular, hollowed-out openings, which are now missing their decorative fillings. Remains of ferrous alloy pins are positioned in the openings, running from top to bottom. These were presumably used to secure the fillings in place and were probably not necessary for the casting process. Four raised, sharp-edged rings protrude from the fibula’s cylindrical body, flanking each globular form. One side of the body ends in a faceted section, which then becomes a looped pin extending to the other side, where it is secured by the thin catchplate’s upturned bottom edge.    The contours of the sides and bottom of the catchplate are rectangular, but the top is deeply cut out, forming a thin projection at the upper corner, on which an ovoid bead with a flattened stem at the top is mounted.

The body arches gently and is made up of three ovoid beads; the larger, central faceted one is flanked by two smaller, unfaceted beads, separated by two raised, sharp-edged rings. After the last bead, the bow becomes rhomboid in section, marked by parallel incisions, dropping sharply down and tapering into what appears to have been a double-looped spring and pin, most of which is missing.

Countering the upward arc of the body, the upper edge of the rectangular catchplate dips down and then dips up to a projecting corner, which is surmounted by a bead with a short stem at the top.   Both sides of the catchplate display abstract incised designs. Side A has multiple borders. Inside the second border, rows of arched lines run along the top and sides. Dotted, concentric semicircles, facing inward, are added to a border at the bottom, and the innermost frame is filled by a hatched double meander.

Her face is in profile, looking down at the crested Corinthian helmet that is balanced on her extended right hand. Her left elbow is resting on top of a column, and she appears to hold a long scepter or spear in her left hand. She wears a simple diadem; her hair is pulled back into a bun. Flying above the goddess are two confronted male cupids; each holds a wreath over the head of the goddess. Another winged cupid stands below her right hand. He is also nude and holds a filleted wreath up to her in his right hand. To the left of the column, a small nude adult male stands in profile to the right. He is clearly an adult but represented at the same scale as the child-like cupids. He holds a scepter or spear in his lowered right hand and another, unclear accoutrement in his left hand. Next to the male figure, a round shield with segments and a pair of greaves lean against the column, which is decorated by a single garland.

304109,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A number of bronze pin fragments are said to have been discovered on a slope right above the sea at Chalcedon (modern Kadıköy), a Megarian Greek colony across the Bosporus from Byzantium (modern Istanbul). The pin fragments were reportedly found just over 40 cm apart together with the remains of human bones, which led P. Jacobsthal to conclude that they were placed in a grave on the shoulders of the deceased (1).   1950.84.19 and 1950.84.20 preserve the upper parts of two dress pins with three flattened globes below a disc-shaped head. The globes are incised with fine vertical grooves and increase in size toward the top of the pin. On 1950.84.20, a ring separates the globes and marks the beginning and end of the sequence; on 1950.84.19, the single rings are replaced by pairs of rings. Both pins have a flat disc with a slightly upturned rim. The upper surface of the disc around the central knob is left plain on 1950.84.19 and is decorated with a rosette on 1950.84.20. The shafts of both pins are circular in section and taper toward the lower point. The now-bent shaft fragment 1950.84.21 may originally have been a lower part of 1950.84.20. 1950.84.22 consists of a thin, round shaft, with a piece of wire wrapped tightly around one portion; the shaft and spiral are incompletely preserved. 1950.84.22 was reportedly part of the same find, and it might represent the tip of a pin, equipped with a point-guard or fastener (2). Alternatively, it may be a fragment of a loop-head pin (“Schlaufennadel”) (3).    There are relatively few Archaic pins with three globes, but these appear to have been more frequent in the northern Aegean. Examples from the late sixth century BCE from Macedonia have heads decorated with an incised rosette or a gold sheet bearing a rosette pattern, but the pins are more slender with more strongly articulated vertical subdivisions of the globes, and the discs have more elaborate rims (4). These comparisons suggest that the Harvard pin fragments are somewhat earlier: a date between the late seventh and mid-sixth centuries BCE would correspond roughly to the date range of their alleged find context (5).

An acanthus tendril with two symmetrical leaves shoots downward from a wide fillet at the base of the handle. A central spike-shaped leaf fills the space between these leaves. From this base two larger leaves, whose inner details are mostly obscured, curve outward to form the base of the attachment. Because no rivets or holes are visible, the handle must have been attached to the vessel by solder.    The underside of the handle and its widening extension to the mouth of the vessel are flat. The upper part of the handle consists of a central, raised spool-like attachment with a depressed center. This attachment is flanked on either side by stylized duck heads. The duck heads emerge from two leaf-like forms that end in rounded knobs.    The naturalistic forms of the acanthus leaves, the duck heads, and the presence of the spool suggest a date for this handle somewhere between 350 and 250 BCE. Parallels for such handles occur on bronze vessels in Macedonian tombs of the second half of the fourth and first half of the third centuries BCE and in the Roman period (1).         NOTES:   1.

304111,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The figure moves with great vigor, his right leg thrust forward, torso held erect, and head turned slightly downward and to the left. Torsion at the hips and the upper body open the composition, creating a dynamic pose. Although broken near the shoulder, the left arm was clearly raised. The right shoulder is slightly lowered, and the right arm, also broken off near the shoulder, is held out from the body. The torso is elongated. Although lacking certain characteristic features, such as pointed ears, a tail, and goat’s horns, the figure is best identified as a satyr in an active pose (1). The broad nose, full lips, large eyes, and wild hair add to the non-Greek, almost mask-like portrayal. The sculptor has placed great emphasis on the bold modeling of the musculature rather than surface detail. The eyes were inlaid, however, and an indentation on the crown of the head may well be an indication that he wore a wreath made of another material (2). Since his arms and lower legs are missing, several restorations are possible. He may be engaged in a chase, a foot race, or a fight. More likely, he is in the act of carrying wine or other attributes of Dionysiac revelry (3).   NOTES:   1. A running or fighting barbarian is a less likely interpretation.   2. This wreath is likely to have taken the form of a grapevine, ivy, or myrtle associating the figure with Dionysos.

304124,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This small sphinx is solid cast, but its front and hind legs, wings, and tail are very skillfully rendered. The wiry dog-like body of the sphinx crouches on its hind legs, the feet of which touch the paws of the vertically placed front legs. A piece at the bottom of the S-shaped tail is missing. The wings curve backward. The right wing ends in a point. A piece of the left wing appears to have been repaired, but the tip of this wing is missing. The upper part of the body and the wings are heavily corroded. No surface ornamentation is visible. The sphinx’s head turns slightly outward to her left. Her alert face features wide, oval incised eyes, a straight nose, and a prominent chin. Her face is surmounted by a rounded roll of hair that projects upward from in front of her two ears. A ridge around the crown of the head suggests that the hair was bound by a fillet. There are traces of horizontal grooving on the mass of hair that descends along the back of the head toward the neck.   Sphinxes, male and female, have long been prominent members of the cast of imaginary composite creatures that populated the ancient Mediterranean imagination. The Egyptian sphinx, with a lion’s body and a male head, is the projection of the fierce fighting power of the pharaoh. This type of sphinx appears to be the inspiration for the small recumbent sphinx in the Harvard collection, 1949.11. The Hellenic sphinx, however, is always female, with a human head and a body that varies between feline and canine characteristics and usually has wings, such as 1950.137 (1). This type is first seen in ivories, wall paintings, and engraved gems of the Aegean mainland in the Late Bronze Age. It then migrates to the Near East, returning to the Greek repertoire during the seventh century BCE and later as a motif in the Orientalizing period. Female sphinxes, dangerous and unpredictable, are especially prominent as guardians of graves (2). The best-known sphinx in Greek mythology is the Theban sphinx who killed any passersby unable to answer her riddle, which was finally solved by Oedipus.   The lean body of this little sphinx, along with the turn of her head, shows a masterful mixture of developed Early Classical anatomy in the body and wings and lingering Archaic qualities in her head and hair. Her pose, situated as if ready to fly up at any moment, strongly resembles that of the great Late Archaic Athenian marble sphinx, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (3), which surmounted an elaborate grave stele dated to c. 530 BCE. Harvard’s sphinx, however, probably dates to c. 470 BCE, or even a little later. Small sphinxes like this were used to adorn the rims of larger bronze vessels and also served as the finials for elaborate bronze pins, such as the pair of miniatures in the MFA (4), and a tiny bronze sphinx in the Princeton Art Museum (5). This sphinx seems fully part of the well-established tradition of sphinxes as fearsome creatures who guarded the dead (6).   NOTES:   1. For Greek sphinxes and their Near Eastern antecedents, see J.

Following the conventions of Archaic male coiffures, this figurine has a low fringe of hair and a thickened roll on his forehead. The surface of his head would have had vertical incisions covering both the front and back nape of the neck. His thick neck is set above narrow shoulders. His head is broad and has large almond-shaped eyes. The tubular torso gives way to outstretched arms that have traits of Geometric period “wiry” figures of seventh century BCE. These characteristics include a flattening of the body, rounded shoulders, the thickening of the neck, “wiry” arms, and a rounded torso. Although generally lacking musculature or other naturalistic features, the ribcage is faintly visible. The stylization of the incised circular depressions representing nipples is characteristic of this type of statuette in the late Archaic period. He may have held in his right hand a ritual object specific to the deity to whom the votive would have been dedicated. The figure has narrow hips, slender legs, and muscular calves.    NOTES:   1.

304126,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A horse stands atop an eight-spoked wheel that has triangular openings between the spokes. The piece is solid cast. It has suffered considerable damage; one entire spoke and most of another have been lost from the lower part of the wheel, along with the section of the rim joining the two wheels. The horse’s tail and most of both ears are also missing. The wheel, broken or cracked in fifteen places, has been reassembled in a way that has left it somewhat skewed.    This piece was probably a pendant worn as personal jewelry suspended by a cord or light chain passed around the body of the horse. The horse and the wheel are decorated on both sides with stamped double concentric circles that have points in their centers, nine on the wheel and six on each side of the horse. A knob and disc project from the lower terminal opposite the horse.    The horse has the characteristics of the Thessalian workshop style as defined by J.-L. Zimmermann (1). The muzzle ends in a bulb. A line of modeling begins at the ears and continues along the side of the head to form cheek muscles. The entire composition is rendered in silhouette. A dynamic tension is imparted to the wheel by placing the stamped circles off-center between the spokes, so that the eye is drawn continuously around the rim.   I. Kilian-Dirlmeier notes the presence of bronze wheels with four, six, or eight spokes, with triangular spaces between the spokes and similarly stamped with circles as decorations, at Thessalian sanctuaries, from a grave in the Chalkidike, and from an unknown site on Ithaka (2). She also reports an eight-spoked wheel stamped with circles and surmounted by a bird from a grave in Thebes (3).   NOTES:   1. On the Thessalian style of Geometric horses, see J.-L.

The shaft is rounded on the back and consists of three broad, flat facets on the front. A crack extends horizontally across the handle near the middle. At the top of the handle, where the thumb of a person picking up the vessel would have rested, a nine-petalled palmette projects from a pair of opposed volutes with relief oculi.    The top of the handle consists of two small, outward-facing lions whose reclining bodies are hollow at the back and whose forepaws each frame a hole for a rivet attachment. The lions’ symmetrical wavy tails extend downward on the upper edges of the handle. The back or underside of the top of the handle terminates in two flanges. The right-hand flange, marked by a hole through which a rivet once passed, has an intact rounded end.   The base plate features a gorgoneion whose hair descends in two wavy relief locks on either side of her face. The tips of these locks turn outward. She has large oval eyes, a stubby nose, and widely spread lips, within which two rows of incised teeth and a protruding tongue are visible. At the base of her neck is the hammered head of a bronze pin or rivet, which extends through the object and still has a small fragment of the hammered vase adhered to its inner left side. Two reclining rams face outward, flanking the gorgoneion. Their tails, with incised diagonal bands suggesting the fleece, extend downward. The rams’ outer forelegs are modeled in the round, as are their outer hindquarters. Each ram has a hole in the middle of its back for a rivet.   This handle belongs to a group of elaborate bronze hydria handles (1); D. K. Hill reasonably attributes these handles and hydriai to a workshop at Corinth, with a date between 540 and 520 BCE (2).

304129,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This female deity of a type known as a Lasa stands on her left foot and gazes to her left as if in a ceremonial pose. A sea monster (a ketos or pistrix) stands next to her left thigh and wraps itself around her leg; it is highly stylized and has a canine-like head, a beard, a spiky long dorsal, and pectoral fins (1). Metal shoes were placed under the original feet due to an old repaired break at the ankles. The angle of the figure’s feet may have been caused by the damaged ankles or by some casting abnormality. The proper left arm is adorned with three hanging objects, while the right arm has one bracelet. Although the object is not preserved, the positioning of the fingers of her right hand suggests that she held a container of perfume or a wand. In her left hand is the alabastron or purse that Lasas used to anoint the dead. Traces of lead and corrosive material inside the base of the cylindrical headpiece indicate that it may have been a support for an incense-burning tray rather than a candelabrum.    “Lasa” was a general term for a type of Etruscan female deity, somewhat like a nymph; an epithet was sometimes given to distinguish specific Lasas (2). A mirror from Vulci shows the Lasa Thimrae with an alabastron in her left hand and a stick for distributing the contents of the alabastron in her right (3). Based on the presence of the sea monster, this Lasa appears to be a specific type of divinatory figure, although her exact identity is unknown. She is also distinguished by her pointed slippers and a light mantle, which is buttoned on one side and drapes over her right shoulder, sensually displaying her left breast and buttocks.   A bronze statuette of a winged Lasa from Perguia, dated c. 300 BCE and now at the Museo Archaeologico, Florence, bears striking similarity to this piece (4). The Perugian Lasa suggests that Etruscan workshops from the fourth century BCE were familiar with the Lasa and sea-monster motif (5), which is rarely depicted in the bronze mirrors that represented winged Lasas engaged with the pantheon of Etruscan divinities. Some mirrors from the late fourth century BCE bearing the inscription “Lasa” show her wearing a peplos with jewelry or a flower and actively engaged in divination. While Lasas appear in the company of a variety of deities on inscribed mirrors, including Jupiter, Athena, Mars, and Herakles, they are frequently companions of Aphrodite (Turan) or Helen, which might indicate an erotic connotation (6). The ratio of winged to wingless Lasas is two to one, making the absence of wings here not unusual.    NOTES:   1. For a description and examples of this sea monster, see K. Shepard, The Fish-tailed Monster in Greek and Etruscan Art (New York, 1940) 28-30 and 58-59, figs. 38-41 and 70. For an analysis with the iconography of Lasas, see R.

Gold pendants of similar form are found in Greece and are dated to the fifth to fourth centuries BCE, but these examples are smaller in size, typically measuring 0.75 to 2.7 cm in length (2). This pendant, made of bronze and significantly larger, could not have been used in the delicate necklaces and bracelets from which gold examples derive.

It could easily have been slipped over the hand to be worn around the wrist. The underside is concave, perhaps in order to decrease the overall weight.   The outer, convex side is segmented into eight units delineated by raised, hatched double bands. A pair of opposed faces in relief decorates the two central segments. The two end segments also bear faces that are mirror images of one another. The top of each face is formed by the double bands, which could also represent the hairline and brows. The lower band on each extends down into a long aquiline nose. The eyes of each face consist of round discs set into large circular indentations. The lower sets of bands may cursorily represent lips, chins, beards, jewelry, or garment necklines. In the case of the central set of opposed faces, the lower bands are shared between the faces that they separate.    This cast two-part hoop is of a distinct type represented by lead, iron, and, most commonly, copper alloy examples (1). The type is distinguished not only by its form, but also by its geometric and figural relief imagery. In addition to human faces, a variety of creatures and animal heads are included in the figural repertoire. Unfortunately, no bracelets of this type have a secure provenience, but all known examples are reported to have come from Luristan. Their imagery, however, has strong stylistic affinities with figures on excavated objects from Luristan dated to the eighth to seventh centuries BCE (2).    NOTES:   1. See P. R. S.

There are square hammer marks visible near the spring closest to the catchplate. The pin is broken and repaired 2 cm from the catchplate. There is green corrosion overall and thick burial accretions around the pin break and the catchplate.   The serpentine fibula has an elegant form that consists of a single length of wire formed into a crescent-shaped fastener for clothing. One end of the wire has been sharpened into a point to puncture the cloth, while the opposite end has been shaped into a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin. Two single springs incorporated into the wire apply tension between the catchplate and pin. The section between the springs, called the bow, curves in harmony with the arch of the pin. There are nineteen serpentine fibulae in the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, and these fibulae have minor stylistic variations in form and decoration. They have no known provenience; however, serpentine fibulae were common during the Iron Age, and they are found distributed throughout Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and France (1).    The serpentine type of fibula is considered to have descended from the Late Bronze Age violin-bow type, which has a straight pin and a single spring. Replacing the violin-bow, the serpentine fibulae came into general use during the Early Iron Age, and the type continued to be used throughout the next half century. During this time, communities created their own types of fibulae, and discrete variations in the form developed. Trade in Italy during the eighth century BCE contributed to the spread of provincial styles; as a result, the traceability of their origins has been complicated. Serpentine fibulae were common in Sicily during Greek colonization, hence the type has also been termed “Sicilian” (2). Changes in the form have been used to date serpentine fibulae, the earliest of which have a flattened spiral catchplate. As the Iron Age progressed, the catchplate developed into a simple, folded channel, which became longer over time (3). 1987.135.53 and 1987.135.40 have the longest catchplates in the collection and probably date to the Late Iron Age, while the remaining fibulae with shorter catchplates are most likely from the Early Iron Age. Some of the fibulae in the Harvard collection have incised decorations, including 1987.135.38, which bears a herringbone pattern partially obscured by corrosion (4). Inscribed, consecutive parallel line patterns, similar to the ones on 1987.135.51, have been found on serpentine fibulae in central Italy (5).    NOTES:   1. Compare serpentine fibulae in J.

304153,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The bareheaded man kneels holding an upside-down trussed ram in his outstretched arms. The man appears to be balding or has a shaved tonsure. He may have a fringe of hair above the eyebrows; he also has sideburns in front of his large, circular modeled ears and locks of straight hair depicted on the back of the head. The eyebrows are large and full, with diagonal lines to indicate hair. The eyes are raised knobs; the nose is prominent and triangular and is much thicker than that of the Sardinian archer in Harvard’s collection, 1952.30—with modeled lips and a simple, narrow chin. The neck is long and proportionately thick. He has narrow shoulders; his curving, unmuscular arms are held away from his body, bent at the elbows and held out, grasping the fore- and hindquarters of the ram with large, long-fingered hands. The torso curves, rather than bends, at the waist, away from the ram and down to the knees; the feet are simply rendered, with some attempt to indicate the toes, which are realistically slightly curved to accommodate the kneeling position. The shepherd wears some kind of tube-like covering on his calves with a raised band at the top and bottom. It is unclear if these are boots or merely leg coverings. His main clothing is somewhat confused: he either wears a short, one shouldered tunic with a double hem, or a short-sleeved tunic with a shorter, one-shouldered tunic over it. The line all the way around the neck supports the former rather than the latter. Over his tunic or tunics, he wears a thick band or baldric that binds what appears to be a version of the typical Sardinian dagger to his back, which is an unusual location. The shepherd is connected to a U-shaped support, forked at each end where it attaches to his knees and feet.   The ram is modeled in the round and is not typical of the other known Sardinian rams (1). It has two curving horns, a lean body, and a small tail. The fore and hind hooves are bound, as shown by bands rendered above the man’s fists. There are faint bands visible on the neck and back of the ram that might be a very simple representation of wool.   Several issues with this object seem to indicate that it is not actually ancient. The only other extant kneeling Sardinian bronze is a part of the wrestler group at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Cagliari (2). In fact, Harvard’s shepherd seems to be a copy of the kneeling wrestler in Cagliari, although with slight variations, such as the placement of the daggers on the two pieces. The Cagliari wrestler wears his dagger on the front of his torso, as does 1952.30, while Harvard’s shepherd wears his on his back, which is a decidedly non-typical placement. The Cagliari wrestler also has slightly different leggings, and his feet are not connected to a U-shaped support, which seems to be unique to the Harvard bronze. Groups of shepherds carrying sheep are known, but they typically show the sheep draped over the shoulders of the standing man (3), making the hold and body position of this bronze unique for a shepherd group. Additionally, none of the known shepherds is depicted wearing daggers at all. Finally, of the 129 Sardinian copper alloy objects published by M. S. Balmuth and R. H. Tykot in 2002, only one other object aside from the Harvard bronze contains a significant amount of zinc (J. Paul Getty Museum, inv. no. 75.AK.110, which has 2.53% zinc), making the 15% zinc detected in two separate samples of the Harvard piece quite suspicious (4).   If the Harvard bronze is fake, the human portion was probably inspired by the wrestler group in Cagliari but was modified to put a ram in the place of the other wrestler. At this point, there is nothing clearly indicating it may be a pastiche. Overall, the metallurgical, art historical, and technical observations point to this object being either entirely or almost entirely a modern fake.   NOTES:   1.

The Harvard piece consists of a vertical, almost plank-like body that rises from a square base; there is a slight bulge on the back, indicating the buttocks. Feet are not shown. The shape of the body does not change from the neck to the base, which suggests that this figure is wearing a peplos or peplos-like garment. Two short sleeves project laterally from the body at the level of the shoulders. The statuette appears to have a very slightly incised diagonal fold or belt looping over its left shoulder. The right arm extends sideways and is bent upward at the elbow, terminating in a flattened fist. The left arm, also extended laterally from the shoulder, is broken off at the wrist, where originally there would probably have been a shield. She wears an open-faced helmet of the Illyrian type (compare 1972.55), with cheek-pieces covering her cheeks and extending down the sides of her chin. A crest rises above the helmet and extends backward beyond the edge of the helmet. Her facial features are roughly rendered, with the lower edge of the brow and eyes slightly in relief and a projecting nose.   This rudimentary but charming Palladion is said to come from Thessaly. It resembles other larger and more detailed examples from Olympia and in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore (1). Perhaps the best-known representations of the Palladion appear on Athenian black- and red-figured vases depicting the sack of Troy, where Cassandra has fled to the protection of the goddess Athena, who is shown in this form (2). The Palladion also appears as a miniature statue in rudimentary form being stolen by the Greek hero Diomedes (3).    If the alleged provenance of this Palladion is trustworthy, we might think of it as a small votive offering to the goddess’s powerful Thessalian form, Athena Itonia. While such rudimentary figures are difficult to date, one might propose a date for this figure near the middle of the sixth century BCE.   NOTES:   1. Olympia Museum, inv. no.

304174,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This figurine, although ill proportioned, is identified with certainty as a horse because of its long neck and tail. A comparable horse figurine in the Godard collection has similar proportions (1). The features on the long, narrow face of the Harvard horse are not defined, although the mouth is open, perhaps indicating the horse has exerted itself though labor or physical activity. The prominent, hollowed-out ears are asymmetrical. Beginning behind the ears, a mane, marked by four small peaks or tufts, extends down the neck. The thick tail also bears vertical ridges mimicking the definition of the mane. On the back is a deep indentation, around which the outline looks raised, probably representing a blanket. A removable rider figurine may originally have been positioned on the horse’s back.   Although the overall form of this horse is crude, because details were added in the metal, it likely was in a satisfactorily finished state and considered acceptable for use. The aesthetic quality of this object, then, was probably not of primary importance; rather, its function, whether physical or symbolic, would have outweighed appearances.   An isolated, mountainous region, Luristan (western Iran) has extensive green valleys that are used today as pastures for horse breeding. Based on the large number of elaborate pieces of ancient copper alloy harness equipment derived from this region, it is evident that horses were culturally significant during the first millennium BCE (2). However, due to limited archaeological survey and excavation, it is not known precisely what role they would have played. Horses are well suited to serve in warfare and as transport for a highly mobile population. They may also have been bred for export as a valuable commodity.    NOTES:   1.

While no indication of eye or ear can be seen on the facing side of the plaque, on the reverse a raised circular lump may represent an eye, with another lump, perhaps a flattened ear, behind. Two vertical loops are present on the reverse of the plaque, above the fore- and hindlimbs (1). The loops are circular in section; only one loop (6 mm high) is preserved. A thin rope or leather thong could have been passed through the loops to attach the plaque.   NOTES:   1. Compare similar loops on the reverse of 2003.246. See also U. Jäger and S.

304177,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"So stylized it is almost featureless, this statuette of a quadruped probably represents a horse. No facial features are indicated on its narrow, triangular head. The long neck gives way to a slender body. A faint raised ridge, possibly representing a mane, extends from the top of the head and down the neck to the shoulders. The four legs are proportionally very short, and the swelling on the rump may be the beginning of a tail. On the underside, just in front of the hind legs, male genitalia are modeled. This detail may reflect the significance of animal sexual potency, perhaps in the context of breeding.   Although a number of horse figurines are known, few come from archaeological contexts. Based on the prominence with which the horse is represented in the material culture of Luristan, these objects are generally attributed to this region. Collections and sale lots of objects primarily from Luristan often include horse figurines (1). It is likely, however, that the present understanding of the distribution of these figurines has been skewed by the horse’s prominence in Luristan, as parallels to this piece do not necessarily center on western Iran, with one example discovered as far north as Koban in the Caucasus (2). At the site of Marlik, in the Caspian basin of northwest Iran, several bronze horse figurines have been excavated, although mostly come from a single tomb (3). These figurines have long, slender necks and bodies, similar in form to the Harvard piece. Also remarkable for their nearly identical proportion to the Harvard piece is a pair of copper alloy horses attached to a model wagon in a private collection (4). This model has been identified as “Middle Elamite” and dated to the first half of the second millennium BCE due to parallels between the cart and Old Babylonian examples from Mesopotamia. The Harvard horse is most likely part of the corpus of copper alloy figurines derived from Iron Age western Iran, from either Luristan or the Caspian basin.   NOTES:   1. J. M.

304178,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This stocky nude male statuette stands with his weight on his right leg and his left leg bent slightly forward. His feet are missing. His complex pose varies markedly from the usual frontality of Early Classical nude male statuettes in the contrapposto stance. The stump of his right arm, raised above shoulder height, extends horizontally to a break just above the elbow. His torso is slightly twisted, and this carries through to his left arm, which is slightly bent at the elbow and hangs down alongside the body to the level of his hip. The left hand is missing. The artist has rendered the musculature of the torso summarily but effectively. The back has a vertical spinal groove that extends to bottom of the buttocks. The youth’s head, with large rounded eyes flanking a long nose and an incised mouth, is tilted downward and slightly to the left. His hair falls in a spreading mass to just below the base of his neck. Curving striations flank a central vertical groove. The top of his head has been artificially flattened. It is unclear whether this was altered to contain the base of a pin. The twisted pose of the youth suggests incipient action of some kind, perhaps boxing, as if the complete right arm may have been delivering a blow to an opponent’s face or chest. Although this statuette is very similar in scale to the youthful flying erotes that sometimes flank bronze mirror caryatids of the early to mid-fifth century BCE, there are no traces of wings on the back of this figure, and the action is markedly different. This youth may have been part of a group of athletes. His date should be around 480 to 450 BCE. An attribution to a Peloponnesian workshop, perhaps one at Argos, seems plausible.  David G.

304179,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A nude youth stands with his weight on his left leg; his right foot is missing just above the ankle. He bends his left knee as he moves his left foot forward. The thrust of his right leg sets up a curving, twisting motion in his torso. The muscular division of his chest and abdomen are rudimentarily modeled. The right side of his inguinal ridge is higher than the left, producing a horizontal crease. His back is also summarily modeled. His spine is a vertical groove that continues between his buttocks. His head turns to the right and downward toward his right arm. His hair is rendered in a cap-like mass, with prominent side locks that cover his ears. His facial features are not preserved.   In his right hand, the youth carries an oval shape, which is connected to his thigh. This appears to be an oinochoe or wine pitcher. In his left hand, he grasps the handle of a circular strainer the interior cavity of which is clearly modeled on both the exterior and interior sides. A rectangular protrusion extending from the wrist to the left hand may represent the handle of the strainer or possibly a strut, and it rather looks like the head of a duck, a feature which was a favorite terminal for handles in Classical serving instruments, especially ladles. The pitcher appears to be a squat trefoil oinochoe. The statuette may have been intended as a finial for the top of a candelabrum or lamp stand (1).    The surface of this statuette is heavily corroded. Extensive areas of incrustation adhere to the back, head, and torso on the left side. This statuette may be a defective casting that was left unfinished deliberately and perhaps lost or discarded. It has also suffered seriously from corrosion and wear, yet some details of the figure, like the strainer and oinochoe, are clearly defined. G. M. A. Hanfmann maintains that the bronze is unfinished. There is a casting line still visible on left shoulder and right arm, and a peg from the casting below the buttocks on the back has been broken off but not removed. He calls the uneven surface a pitted “fireskin,” the original surface of the casting before it has been cleaned and finished.   This statuette of a youth could be ascribed to an Athenian workshop active during the second quarter of the fifth century BCE.   NOTES:   1.

The head has short, curved horns and a thick mass of curls on its forehead.    Bovine heads served as appliques on a variety of objects in the Hellenistic period (1). It has been suggested that the vertical rod may have been inserted into a chariot railing and that the rings served as rein guides (2). This type, with three rings attached, recalls bull’s head protomes that were riveted onto bronze cauldrons at Urartu in the eighth century BCE. The type appears to have had a long history stretching into the Roman Imperial period, and smaller examples from that period have been interpreted as votives (3).

304183,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This large, heavy handle terminates in the head of a feline, whose neck is enclosed in a ruff of hair emerging from an eight-petaled calyx. Each petal has a tiny knob at the tip. The mouth is open, showing four incisors, and the tongue hangs down as though the animal is panting from the heat of the flame. Its right eye is round, while the left is almond-shaped and has a punched pupil. Parallel lines of light stippling indicate fur on the top of its head. A groove in the center of its brow divides the fur into a tuft over each eye. Striations represent the fur on the neck, whiskers, muzzle, and brows. A parted section of fur is shown on the handle. A collar with diagonal grooves suggests that a twisted rope is represented around the neck. At the opposite end is a palmette attachment plate where the handle was joined to the reservoir.   Felines were common terminals on Roman lamp handles in the Imperial period. Some held the chain to a lid in their mouths (1). This particular head is comparable to two on tripod legs in the Walters Art Museum dated by D. K. Hill to the end of the third century CE (2). The Walters’ panthers have large spots, while the Harvard panther does not. Moreover, the fact that the Latin word pantherae could refer to leopards or any of the class of spotted felines cautions us against using the term “panther” too readily (3). An earlier date for this piece can be suggested by comparison with pieces found at Pompeii (4).               Lamp handles 1965.26 and 1969.177.25 represent a type that is well known from finds at Pompeii and Herculaneum and was popular throughout the Roman Empire from the late first century BCE into the third century CE (5). The bodies of the intact lamps are pear-shaped with a central fill hole and a rounded or splayed and fluked nozzle. The handles curve upward from the point of attachment on the side of the reservoir with the terminus over the center of the reservoir. The lamps were made to sit on a stand or tripod, to be suspended from chains, or to be held by the handle, which was usually cast separately from the body and attached with lead solder. The handles are D-shaped in section, and the undersides are very smooth.    NOTES:   1. See D. M.

The bow and the portion of wire leading to the catchplate have incised parallel lines perpendicular to the wire axis. The pin is broken and reattached approximately 1 cm from the closest spring. The surface has green corrosion and thick burial accretions overall.      The serpentine fibula has an elegant form that consists of a single length of wire formed into a crescent-shaped fastener for clothing. One end of the wire has been sharpened into a point to puncture the cloth, while the opposite end has been shaped into a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin. Two single springs incorporated into the wire apply tension between the catchplate and pin. The section between the springs, called the bow, curves in harmony with the arch of the pin. There are nineteen serpentine fibulae in the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, and these fibulae have minor stylistic variations in form and decoration. They have no known provenience; however, serpentine fibulae were common during the Iron Age, and they are found distributed throughout Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and France (1).    The serpentine type of fibula is considered to have descended from the Late Bronze Age violin-bow type, which has a straight pin and a single spring. Replacing the violin-bow, the serpentine fibulae came into general use during the Early Iron Age, and the type continued to be used throughout the next half century. During this time, communities created their own types of fibulae, and discrete variations in the form developed. Trade in Italy during the eighth century BCE contributed to the spread of provincial styles; as a result, the traceability of their origins has been complicated. Serpentine fibulae were common in Sicily during Greek colonization, hence the type has also been termed “Sicilian” (2). Changes in the form have been used to date serpentine fibulae, the earliest of which have a flattened spiral catchplate. As the Iron Age progressed, the catchplate developed into a simple, folded channel, which became longer over time (3). 1987.135.53 and 1987.135.40 have the longest catchplates in the collection and probably date to the Late Iron Age, while the remaining fibulae with shorter catchplates are most likely from the Early Iron Age. Some of the fibulae in the Harvard collection have incised decorations, including 1987.135.38, which bears a herringbone pattern partially obscured by corrosion (4). Inscribed, consecutive parallel line patterns, similar to the ones on 1987.135.51, have been found on serpentine fibulae in central Italy (5).   NOTES:   1. Compare serpentine fibulae in J.

His right hand rests on a part of the rocky mass on which he sits. His right leg is extended with the knee bent and his left leg folded behind it. Three-dimensional folds of a piece of fabric project from beneath his right hip. His hair is arranged in a roll at the nape of his neck. A long, loose curl hangs behind his right shoulder; two smaller locks are visible on either side of the base of his neck. His spread wings frame his torso, with the tips of the feathers of his left wing extending almost to the edge of the relief. His face is modeled almost in the round and features a long nose, small closely set eyes, a slightly open mouth, and a rounded chin (1).    The Eros has suffered major losses, especially on the right side of his head, lower thigh, and upper part of his right leg below the knee. Longitudinal cracks appear in his right arm and left forearm, as well as in the lower part of the knobby mass of rock upon which Eros sits. A gray substance fills in portions of the periphery, feathers and top of the right wing, and the area between the right foot and the end of the right wing.   Associated with the relief figure is a fragmentary mirror disc (1972.33.B). It also has the lumpy dark gray corrosion products on both sides. The third part of this mirror ensemble (1972.33.C) has a heavy raised rim consisting of two convex fillets within narrower raised ridges.    An elongated rectangular cavity on one edge of the rim cuts through the upper convex fillet, probably intended for a hinge attached to the cover. The underside is marked by two concentric convex fillets bounded by pairs of smaller ridges that surround a central raised circular element consisting of a flattened central area with a small central cavity.

The man, rendered in three-quarter view, wears only a silver-inlaid diadem decorated with a centrally placed round ornament, a short dappled cape that billows behind him, and ankle-high laced boots. He holds a bundle of leafy branches in his right hand. The tightly reined horse appears to be in motion, with its right foreleg raised. The horse’s bridle and the man’s nipples were originally also inlaid. The rider sits on an animal skin, perhaps of a panther, that has numerous fine incisions to indicate fur.     Although this relief had previously been dated to the Roman Imperial period, there is nothing that clearly indicates its date is so late (1). The use of a panther pelt as a saddle blanket is thought to have come into vogue in Greek art only after Alexander’s conquests in the East (2). The high quality of this relief, its strong classicizing elements, and the heroic nudity of the figure on horseback are appropriate to a date in the Hellenistic era, when there was already a long tradition of images of heroes with horses. The diadem, which is a traditional symbol of kingship, may indicate that a Hellenistic king is represented here in a posthumous heroic portrait. Two circular holes, one at the top of the cape and the other between his left shoulder and the horse’s mane, would have served to attach the applique to another object, such as a box or piece of furniture.

The heads are naturalistically rendered, with wooly fleece indicated by means of a dimpled pattern on the head and neck. Each segmented horn curves around the pointed ear; the hairs on the inside of the ear are depicted. On each side, the eye is inlaid with silver, and a raised circle with a central depression indicates the iris and pupil of the eye. The snout and nostrils are molded, while a line indicates the mouth. On the front of the handle, between the noses of the two heads, a band of short vertical lines is surrounded on all sides by a beaded border. The back of the handle is open, and the underside is concave and undecorated. The walls of the handle are relatively thick, especially at the back, although they are thinner nearer the front.   The exact function of this object is not entirely clear; the handle’s form best resembles that of pottery bell kraters, but no bronze bell kraters have survived from antiquity. It might have been a decorative element for a piece of furniture, as is suggested for the Thorvaldsen Museum example.   NOTES:   1. Compare a similar piece in the Thorvaldsen Museum, Copenhagen, published in T. Melander, Thorvaldsens antikke bronzer (Copenhagen, 2009) 97, no. 130, fig. 73. The Copenhagen piece is described as a decorative furniture element, potentially to cover the end of an armrest, dated to the fifth to fourth centuries BCE.   Lisa M. Anderson",NULL,NULL
304197,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This statuette standing frontally has an elongated torso and separate legs that join just above the small projecting feet. Male genitalia are clearly rendered. Both arms curve forward horizontally from the shoulders. The fingers on the left fist were rendered in the cast. The right hand, which has stubby articulated fingers, is held open and palm up; in it is placed a small rectangular object that has a small projection at the outer end. The statuette’s large oval head sits atop an elongated neck and is dominated by a large vertical nose that descends from the eyebrows. The eyes are almost imperceptible raised oval areas. A horizontal groove beneath the nose serves as the mouth, which may have been incised after casting. A high, pointed spike-like headdress projects vertically from the top of the head. The front surface has been abraded. This statuette is clearly a votive offering but differs from many other comparable pieces in that it holds an object in its extended right hand. Its general proportions and the prominent conical feature atop its head relate it both to the Syro-Hittite Levantine tradition and, to a lesser extent, to Hittite Empire statuettes. The conical headdress suggests that it may represent a deity. However, its charmingly awkward modeling reveals it to be a provincial product, perhaps best characterized as a piece of “folk art.”   David G. Mitten",NULL,NULL
304198,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Broken just below the hips, the remaining portion of this figurine preserves the characteristic body shift from a primarily frontal torso to sideways-oriented legs. The round, tubular body displays no musculature and supports the head on a long, thick neck. The figure wears a high conical headdress, the base of which merges seamlessly into the face. Two small, deep holes mark the eyes, and the ears are represented by quasi-triangular flaps that stick out slightly. The proper left side of the face is marred by a deep gouge. The arms are posed in the characteristic smiting position. They are flattened with no differentiation between arm and hand; the ends are pierced. The high, rounded headgear is reminiscent of O. Negbi’s “Byblo-Egyptian” group and H. Seeden’s Group VII, which include the numerous early second millennium copper alloy figurines found buried in hoards throughout the sacred temple area at Byblos on the coast of Lebanon (1). Seeden argues that the smiting position starts in the early part of the second millennium BCE but is primarily to be associated with the Late Bronze Age, and this piece may be related to several of the loose finds at Byblos that have been dated to the later part of the second millennium (2).   The geographical area of the Levant, comprising the regions of present-day Israel, Lebanon, western Syria, and south-central Turkey, produced an extraordinary number of small copper alloy figurines from the end of the third millennium into the beginning of the first millennium BCE (3). Most of these figurines depict a standing male figure with left foot advancing and right arm raised in a position of smiting (4). Often the hands are pierced with holes to hold weapons or armor. These separate elements are preserved in a few examples, the most spectacular being a warrior holding a spear and shield found in a late thirteenth or early twelfth century BCE building at Enkomi on Cyprus (5). The figurines have a wide distribution, with examples found as far away as Greece, but the majority is concentrated along the Mediterranean coast of the Levant (6).   While the figurines share a common conceptual underpinning, the actual forms and styles of the small copper alloys display a remarkable range of diversity. In general, they appear to move along a spectrum from those that include a high degree of Egyptianizing elements, presumably produced in regions closer to Egypt, to those showing stronger affinities with the Hittite artistic tradition of central Turkey. Such stylistic features are evident in the shape and type of the tall crown, the form of the short skirt or kilt, and the proportions of the body. The basic iconography of the smiting figure is derived from the Egyptian image of Pharaoh defeating his enemies; yet, there is no exact parallel in Egypt, indicating a peculiarly Levantine iconographic conception. The figure most likely represents a deity, sometimes identified as either Baal or Reshep, two West Semitic gods. Although no definitive evidence exists to support these attributions, some examples have horns on their headdresses, which are a Near Eastern attribute of divinity (7). Where archaeological contexts are sufficiently well preserved, the figurines are clearly associated with cultic spaces. The largest group of excavated figurines comes from several locations in the temple complex at Byblos on the Lebanese coast, while another set was excavated in a Late Bronze Age temple complex at Kamid el-Loz in inland Lebanon (8). The precise dating of the figurines remains fraught for several reasons. First, many were hoarded and only buried well after their date of manufacture. Second, there is only poor information available, if there is any at all, on the provenience of a large portion of the figurines in museum collections. Finally, while the overall conception of the figurines unites them as a group, the diversity of individual features and styles often makes stylistic comparisons difficult.    NOTES:   1. O.

A slight groove above the projection suggests a lower hemline of a garment. The shoulders and arms form a triangular area. The hands reach upward to touch two rounded, pellet-shaped breasts. The head features a projecting beak-like nose, with slashed mouth and two bulging pellet-shaped eyes in front of the horizontally projecting triangular ears. The back of the figure is smooth.  This charming, rudimentary statuette clearly represents a nude goddess of the Astarte type. However, its lack of distinguishing characteristics makes it difficult to assign it to a particular region. It was probably a votive offering in a sanctuary somewhere in the Levantine coast or Cilicia. While there are no immediately comparable examples have been found, the statuette may be grouped very loosely within the broad area of votive figurines representing a nude fertility goddess that are known from Cilicia down the Levantine coast to Israel during the Late Bronze Age.

A single horizontal line marks the mouth, which recedes into the chin and neck. The figure wears a conical headdress that terminates abruptly with a flat top. It bears a central incised “feathering” design along the front, which may be meant to represent multiple pairs of horns—an attribute of divinity (1). A similar bronze figure, dated to the end of the second millennium, was excavated at Enkomi on Cyprus, although it stands immobile with its legs together (2). The Harvard bronze wears a short kilt, which is secured by a belt at the waist that conceals the transition from the frontal torso to the sideways legs. The legs, especially the back one, display irregularities in the bronze casting. These might be interpreted as greaves, such as those found on a famous spear-wielding bronze figure from Enkomi; they may also simply be the product of a casting flaw (3).    NOTES:   1.

Thickest at the center, it narrows toward its flat terminals, which are incised with zigzags. Due to its weight and diameter, this piece is much too large to have been worn as a bracelet and was instead probably an anklet. Most anklets that have been found on skeletons are 9 to 13 cm in diameter; some examples, such as those found at the cemetery of Tepe Kazabad in central Luristan, are considerably larger. Anklets similar to this example were discovered at the site of Tepe Giyan in eastern Luristan and at Cemetery B of Tepe Sialk in northwest Iran where they were worn in pairs by both sexes (1). However, other evidence from Iron Age III contexts at the Luristan sites of Djubi-i Gauhar and Chamahzi Mumah suggests that anklets were a primarily female style of adornment (2).    Armlets are a jewelry type known from Neo-Assyrian art and texts of the first half of the first millennium BCE in Mesopotamia, and they have been discovered on skeletons in Achaemenid burials of the sixth to third centuries BCE (3). The form of armlets and anklets can be indistinguishable, and their diameter is not a consistent marker of function, as it would have varied in relation to the proportions of the wearer. It has been observed, however, that armlets generally weigh less than anklets. On this basis, although its discovery context is unknown, the heavy hoop presented here is described as an anklet.   It has been suggested that heavy metal anklets of this sort were actually a form of currency in Iron Age Iran (4). Coinage was not yet developed, and weight in metal was presumably used as the standard medium for exchange, although a barter economy would also have been in place. In any case, this ornament would probably have served to display the wealth, if not the social rank and position, of the individual to whom it belonged.   NOTES:   1. See G. Contenau and R.

The remaining portion is surrounded by a notched edge on the obverse; the reverse carries a simple guilloche border, within which stand four figures (two male and two female) in front of an architectural structure. The identities of the figures are uncertain, although R. De Puma suggests that they could be Helen and Clytemnestra flanked by the Dioskouroi (1).   There are ten Etruscan bronze mirrors in the collection of the Harvard Art Museums, ranging in date from the early fifth century to the mid second century BCE. All the mirrors bear engraved designs, and the more elaborately decorated medallions contain scenes involving human or divine figures. Identifiable subjects include a seated Hermes and Lasa (1932.56.38), as well as two young men wearing short chitons and Phrygian caps on 1932.56.37, who may be the Dioskouroi (2). The subjects depicted on other mirrors are more difficult to identify with certainty. For example, the figures on this mirror may be Helen, Clytemnestra, and the Dioskouroi (3), while on another scene, less well preserved, shows a figure wearing a peplos and helmet flanked on the left by a man in a short tunic and boots, and on the right by an unidentified woman wearing a peplos and Phrygian cap (1977.216.2311). The central figure is most likely Athena (Etruscan Menrva), and while the figure on the left leans on a club similar to the one often carried by Herakles, it is unusual for that hero to be shown clothed (4). The three stand before a two-story Ionic structure.   Two mirrors in the collection show signs of an interesting afterlife. The disc of 1977.216.2311 has been perforated in ten places, probably as a means of ensuring that the object would be useless to the living and could be permanently dedicated to the deceased; a less plausible suggestion is that the mirror was reused as a strainer (5). Another mirror in the collection (1977.216.3422), if it is ancient, seems to have been reworked in modern times by an engraver who added to the medallion a female bust, a recumbent male, and an inscription. Neither the style nor the subject of the engraving corresponds to examples known from other Etruscan mirrors, and both the engraving and the inscription appear to have been made with a modern instrument (6).

Two beaded elements between three raised rings flank this swollen section at each end. After these beaded elements, the body flattens on one side and runs down, forming a pin, round in section, which loops twice before running straight to the narrow catchplate at the opposite end of the fibula. The profile of the catchplate tapers upwards before curving toward the central bulge of the body. Incised hatch marks appear on the beaded elements. Tremolo lines are also present on the flattened sections, ending on one side before the double loop and on the other before the catchplate.   Fibulae found on Crete are closest to this one in general shape (1). It seems likely that the fibula was made on the island in the eighth century BCE.   NOTES:   1. See Chr.

304230,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This cast plaque was originally fitted at the left with a pin that attached it to a buckle, and at the right with a loop that secured it to a belt. The fitting preserves two hinges at the left side; portions of pins are still lodged within the hinges. Only a stub of the loop is preserved at the upper right corner (1).    The scene is schematically but legibly rendered. In the center stands a figure in a chariot pulled by horned quadrupeds, most likely bulls. The charioteer is positioned frontally; the bulls turn their bodies outward in opposite directions but twist their heads toward the center. The figure has chin-length hair, is clothed in a robe, and holds a rein in each raised hand. A plain, linear border frames the vignette. The charioteer lacks any identifying attributes and seems to represent a generic figure. The reverse of the plaque is undecorated.    Fittings of similar format have been found throughout the eastern Mediterranean as well as in Hungary and Bulgaria. This type of buckle was in use throughout the early and middle Byzantine periods (2). Several close comparanda for the format and iconography of the Harvard plaque come from eastern Mediterranean sites, including Smyrna (modern Izmir, Turkey) and Colophon, and are dated to the seventh century CE (3). The former owner of the Harvard belt fitting, Oscar Van Lennep, was from a family of Dutch traders and consuls who settled in Smyrna in the early eighteenth century CE, and the original publication for the belt plate indicates that he acquired it in nearby Colophon (4).

304233,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This lamp is pear-shaped with a flat top that is surrounded by a sharp, thin rim (2.4 mm thick) extending along the top of the nozzle and around the wick hole. There is no evidence for an attached lid over the large, round pour hole (2.6 cm in diameter). A crescent-shaped handle guard, from which one tip is missing, was cast with the body. Below it is a flat strap handle that is attached at the low point of the crescent and the center of the body. On either side, at the point where the nozzle and body join, is the stub of a suspension ring. A complete, very small ring is at the center of the crescent. The underside of the ring foot (3.39 cm in diameter) shows concentric turn marks with a button in the center. The height of the reservoir is 3.1 cm, and the height of the handle is 2.45 cm.   The lamp is similar to several examples found at Pompeii and Herculaneum with preserved suspension devices. It is also similar to an example with a stopper for the fill hole and a ring through the loop on the crescent, which holds chains attached to the stopper and an implement for adjusting the wick (1). Such lamps were popular throughout the Roman Empire (2). The type appears to be specifically Roman, developed in the first century CE, and it is the forerunner of factory lamps such as one from Thrace that has the name of the maker cast on its crescent symbol (3).

Two Greek inscriptions cast with the lunula are translated “Posidoro’s lamp” and “Hore, son of Moikaporo.” Krunić posits that the first is the maker and the second is the first owner.

304240,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A number of bronze pin fragments are said to have been discovered on a slope right above the sea at Chalcedon (modern Kadıköy), a Megarian Greek colony across the Bosporus from Byzantium (modern Istanbul). The pin fragments were reportedly found just over 40 cm apart together with the remains of human bones, which led P. Jacobsthal to conclude that they were placed in a grave on the shoulders of the deceased (1).   1950.84.19 and 1950.84.20 preserve the upper parts of two dress pins with three flattened globes below a disc-shaped head. The globes are incised with fine vertical grooves and increase in size toward the top of the pin. On 1950.84.20, a ring separates the globes and marks the beginning and end of the sequence; on 1950.84.19, the single rings are replaced by pairs of rings. Both pins have a flat disc with a slightly upturned rim. The upper surface of the disc around the central knob is left plain on 1950.84.19 and is decorated with a rosette on 1950.84.20. The shafts of both pins are circular in section and taper toward the lower point. The now-bent shaft fragment 1950.84.21 may originally have been a lower part of 1950.84.20. 1950.84.22 consists of a thin, round shaft, with a piece of wire wrapped tightly around one portion; the shaft and spiral are incompletely preserved. 1950.84.22 was reportedly part of the same find, and it might represent the tip of a pin, equipped with a point-guard or fastener (2). Alternatively, it may be a fragment of a loop-head pin (“Schlaufennadel”) (3).    There are relatively few Archaic pins with three globes, but these appear to have been more frequent in the northern Aegean. Examples from the late sixth century BCE from Macedonia have heads decorated with an incised rosette or a gold sheet bearing a rosette pattern, but the pins are more slender with more strongly articulated vertical subdivisions of the globes, and the discs have more elaborate rims (4). These comparisons suggest that the Harvard pin fragments are somewhat earlier: a date between the late seventh and mid-sixth centuries BCE would correspond roughly to the date range of their alleged find context (5).

The rounded plaque is adorned with a recessed, symmetrical foliate design. A small tab protrudes from the end. Two aligned loops on the reverse were used to attach the buckle to a belt; otherwise the surface of the reverse is flat and undecorated. The piece belongs to a category of buckles known as “Syracusan,” which take their name from the find spot of some of the earliest recorded examples (1). This common type is found across a broad geographical area, including northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Near East, and is typically dated to the late sixth or seventh century CE (2).  Each of the three copper alloy Byzantine belt buckles in the Harvard collection consists of two separately cast pieces: a plaque with a loop and a tongue. The tongue was passed through a hole in the plaque and twisted closed. In this example and 1968.95, indentations in the bars keep the tongues in place. Loops on the reverse of each buckle were sewn to one end of a belt, which was most likely made of leather.    Belts could be used with a variety of garments, including trousers or tunics, and were typically worn by men (3). Some belts were embellished with elaborate decoration and wrought in valuable materials, including enamel, luxury metals, or precious stones. Although the Harvard buckles are of modest material and workmanship, each of these utilitarian objects was enhanced by ornamental designs.   NOTES:   1. J.

304250,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"In this hanging attachment, a tabula ansata with a heavy ring on a knob at the top is supported in the center by the joined tails or caudal fins of two dolphins and on the sides by volutes that rest on the heads of the dolphins. A rudimentary palmette hangs below the point where the dolphins’ tails come together. The bodies of the dolphins are hollow on the underside. The nose of each dolphin is flattened to rest on a rectangular socket (2.1 x 1.9 cm and 2.3 x 1.75 cm) with upper and lower moldings and attachment holes (4.5 mm) in front and back so that a pin could go directly through.   The upper and lower moldings of the tabula ansata, bases, and volutes are decorated with slanted, parallel hatches. The spaces between the handles and the framing molding of the tabula ansata are triangular; there is no trace of an inscription.   The stylized dolphins have depressed, fish-like eyes with raised pupils. One has a pectoral fin and flukes below the head; the other has a knob rather than a fin on the head and a row of bumps below.   A very similar device that suspended a double piriform lamp, with more graceful and finely modeled dolphins, was found at Herculaneum (1). The Harvard lamp hanger is larger and heavier and could have supported a lamp with five or six lights, such as 1990.71, or a polycandelon. The similarity of the opening formed by the curved back of the dolphins and the volutes to a rein guide on a wagon or chariot has been noted, but the best parallels are found in connection with lamps (2). A lamp hanger of similar dimensions in the Malcove collection has identically arranged elements, but the tabula is more elongated and the dolphins are less natural, rendered almost like sea monsters. The tabula is inscribed with a dedication in letters whose forms C. P. Jones dates between the late second and early fourth centuries CE (3).   NOTES:   1. See M. Conticello de’ Spagnolis and E.

304251,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This double-edged razor has an oblong shape and a series of 13 circular perforations of two different sizes in a simple pattern down the center of the blade. The blade is of uniform thickness, and there is no sign of incised decoration. The blade is extensively chipped along the edges, although the flat bottom appears to be intact. The ring handle with two decorative spurs does not seem to belong to this blade; spurred handles are not a feature of this type, and indeed, the x-radiograph shows that the two sections have been joined together. The metal of the handle is thicker than the blade. The surface patina is olive green.   This object may be classified as a variant of V. Bianco Peroni’s type “Marino,” which is dated to the tenth century BCE and has a distribution, based on the few known findspots, in central and southern Italy (1).    It is difficult to understand the use and symbolism of the bronze objects from Iron Age Italy that are classified as razors. Possibly used for trimming hair or beards, these razors seem to have had some symbolic value. They are typically found in male burials, and their inclusion in grave goods may indicate that the deceased was a man of mature age; or, in cases where they are found in female burials, they may be indicative of the owner’s elevated social status (2). Some razors have been found with fibulae fastened through the handle, demonstrating that they could be worn (3). Many examples have repaired handles, showing that the razors were important enough to fix if broken (4).   Razors are typically plain or covered with incised decoration, most frequently lines, bands of interlocking triangles, meanders, lines of dots hatched swastikas, and Maltese crosses. The two-edged examples, like this one, more often bear incised concentric circles or have decorative perforations on the blade. Often there are decorative spurs, crescents, or volutes on the handles, depending on the type.   NOTES:   1. V.

One end is broken, but the other end and the edges of the long sides are preserved. The panel is decoratively divided into a framed section and an open field with inlaid linear decoration. One side of the molded frame is egg-and-dart, done in higher relief than the rest of the panel. On the other side and the interior portion of the frame is lesbian cymatium with a raised bevel on the exterior edge. The remains of guidelines, as with 1992.317, 1992.319, and 1992.321, can be seen extending away from the frame into the field. The inlaid decoration, where it survives, is currently dark brown in color and is better preserved within the frame than in the other section. Within the frame, the decoration is a curved line that splits into two curled ends, perhaps representing vines; in the other section of the panel is a large diamond shape, with an equal-armed cross in the middle and smaller diamonds drawn within the two lateral corners. A hooked line emerges out of each side of the large diamond. This panel may be from the same piece of furniture as 1992.319 and 1992.321.    These fragmentary panels would have been placed in a decorative band around the sides of a Roman couch (kline) or table. Based on similarities in decoration and method of manufacture, they may all have been created in a single workshop or by one craftsman. The molded frames are the same on five of the six objects, while the sixth is unfinished.   A first-century CE panel very similar to two of Harvard’s panels (1992.316 and 1992.320) was among the large hoard of bronzes found in the excavations of the Basilica of Bavay, France, in 1969 (1). The burial of the hoard is dated to the fourth century CE, but the makeup of the hoard (statuettes, instrumenta, and scraps) as well as the presence of earlier items, such as the Bavay furniture panel and a Hellenistic Eros, indicates that the items were assembled from many sources and were perhaps going to be melted down (2).   The decoration of grape vines, leaves, and clusters, alluding to wine, are seen on two of the panels (1992.316 and 1992.320) and would have been appropriate decoration for Roman couches, which often bore images of Dionysus and his entourage (3). The couches were used for dining or sleeping, a motif often referenced in Dionysiac imagery.   NOTES:   1. S. Boucher and H.

304279,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This figure’s gorgoneion, Corinthian helmet, and cloak make its identification as the goddess Minerva clear. The figure’s style suggests a second to third century CE date; the elegantly turned neck and the detail and naturalism of the face both point to a relatively early date of manufacture (1). Minerva was an unusual choice of form in the Roman period, although she was a popular figure for early Byzantine steelyards.   Steelyards were commonly used throughout the ancient Mediterranean. These crossbeams would have a weight, usually in the form of a person or deity, that slid along the bar of the scale to measure bulk goods (2). Not surprisingly, many of the Late Roman and Byzantine examples with known findspots have been found along a coast or in shipwrecks, reflecting their commercial utility. The standard term in English, “steelyard,” is a bit misleading, deriving from the use of similar scales in the area on the north bank of the Thames, London, where steel merchants clustered until 1597. In the Roman period, a wide range of figures was represented on the weights, reflecting the diversity of forms of Roman small bronzes in general. By the fourth to fifth century CE, this multiplicity had narrowed and almost all steelyards used weights represented a generic empress type (e.g., 2007.104.3.A-C) or the goddess Athena (Minerva) (3). Although many late examples have been dated generally to the Late Roman period, the most firmly dated example is from the seventh-century shipwreck of Yassi Ada, off the coast of modern Turkey (4). The holdings of the Harvard Art Museums represent the lively eclecticism of this category of bronze, including busts of an empress type, a Minerva, an emperor and an ambiguous nude.   The basic shape of the bust weights was probably created from the lost-wax process, with later refinements added as the materials cooled. The hollow core was filled with lead to achieve the required weight, and a thin bronze sheet on the bottom capped the lead filling. Variations appear in the manufacture of different categories of the weights. The upper loop, with which the figure would be attached to the upper scale, was aligned in two different directions: the loop on the empress bust weights ran front-to-back, while the Minerva bust weights, in contrast, had a top loop that presents its circular face to the viewer. Furthermore, the Minerva weights possess rectangular socles, and the empress weights have oval socles.   NOTES:   1. A very similar bust weight in Catania is published in N. Franken, Aequipondia: Figurliche Laufgewichte römischer und frühbyzantinischer Schnellwaagen (Alfter, 1994) 138, no. A106, pl. 31.   2. For steelyards and bust weights in general, see ibid.   3.

304285,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This ibex-shaped figurine functioned as a lock. The animal has a distinctive rounded horn, articulated with a striated pattern to represent a spiral. It wears a harness at its shoulders. The lock was originally composed of two concave pieces joined together with pins, but the second, matching plaque is now lost. A locking mechanism was positioned in the interior. The separately cast bolt, also lost, slid horizontally into the lock; one prong entered the tail of the animal, the other entered a small groove between the horn and the head.  To close the lock, the bolt was inserted through one end of the animal’s body and secured at the other. It is unclear whether the lock was released by a slide key inserted into the tail or chest of the animal or a turnkey inserted into the center of the lost plaque (1).   Locks of this design and style continued to be made in modern times (2). While the Harvard piece may be of medieval origin, it is equally possible that it was produced more recently.   NOTES:   1.

The fibula features a large, rectangular catchplate with a flaring upper contour. The body, emerging from the upper corner of the catchplate, is arched at the top with a faceted bead between two sections, which are decorated with multiple raised rings. It then bends strongly downward toward a loop, terminating in a straight pin that was once held by the catchplate. Much of the body and pin is rhomboid in section. The body and pin are intact, but the bottom edge and some areas along the sides of the catchplate are missing.   The incised decoration on the catchplate’s two sides presents two opposing polarities. Side A depicts three stacked fish with triangular fins facing left within a sketchily executed frame of multiple borders (2). Only one fin is visible on the fish at the bottom of the frame. A similar border is used on side B, where a horse is shown with front and back legs held apart facing right, with a bird perched on its tail. The left and right thighs are shown separated. A crooked double line falls from the horse’s muzzle and may represent a stream of water. Zigzags fill the upper right corner of the frame. A diamond appears under the horse’s abdomen, and two triangular objects are placed between the front and back legs. As with many other similarly decorated plate fibulae, the horse and bird may represent land and air, and the fish may represent the airless sphere of the sea. The common antithetical juxtaposition of these images on Geometric plate fibulae and other incised metalwork suggests an intentional thematic comparison (3).   NOTES:   1. For Pherai, see K.

Her outstretched right hand is missing, as are the ends of the triangular bracket that rises from the woman’s head. The modeling of the drapery is summary; the peplos hangs in a raised V-shape at the neck. The high breasts are placed very close to each other. Her left arm hangs down beside the body and clutches the fold of the drapery in the typical Archaic gesture. There is a trace of an incised circular button or brooch at the top of the right shoulder. The modeling on the reverse is very summary. The left hand blends into the drapery that it grasps; there is no definition of the fingers. The figure’s head sits on a slender neck. Her eyes are closely set; her nose is short with rounded tip, beneath which a small, pursed mouth is summarily rendered. Her hair is gathered in a convex roll over the forehead, bunching above the ears. The back of the hair continues in a roll marked with indistinct vertical incisions. Horizontal incisions define the roll of hair over the forehead. Behind it, vertical incisions reach to the bottom of the spreading bracket that rises from the head. There is no clear demarcation between the top of the head and the bottom of the mirror-support bracket.   When seen from the side, the lower part of the figure is virtually linear, with no marked modeling of the abdomen and legs. On the back of the head, the bracket rises from the hair mass with no separation or definition.    This caryatid is typical of the more summarily modeled small mirror caryatids of the early Classical style (1). The modeling of the head, the peplos, and the overall proportions suggest a date of c. 460 BCE. It seems likely that this figure and the mirror that it supported were made in Corinth, Argos, or another nearby workshop in the northeastern Peloponnesus.   NOTES:   1. For parallels, see L. O. K.

304308,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Tall and thin, this smiting figure pairs an unusual combination of rounded forms on the upper section with flat, geometrically ribbed elements below. The frontal torso shifts into the flat sideways-oriented lower body at the waist, where the juncture is concealed by a double ribbed belt. The figure wears a short kilt edged by two horizontal ribs, with a tab descending between the legs. The attenuated legs end in ball-like feet with the toes indicated by irregular incisions. Two rounded tangs extend from below the feet for attachment. The head is modeled fully in the round and is large in proportion to the rest of the body. The long face, with fleshy nose and sizeable pierced ears jutting from the sides, resembles those found on examples from Byblos and Tyre on the Lebanese coast dating to the early second millennium BCE; however, none of these examples displays the modified Egyptian White Crown or the flat-banded kilt seen here (1). These early pieces hold both arms extended out in front rather than in the smiting posture with the right arm raised. The distinctive rendering of the skirt has no clear parallels among published bronzes (2), although the representation of a tab between the legs occurs on depictions of Syrians in the Late Bronze Age (3). The figure holds a small round bowl in the left hand, which may be compared to seated examples of a rather different style from the Levantine coast and Cyprus (4).    The geographical area of the Levant, comprising the regions of present-day Israel, Lebanon, western Syria, and south-central Turkey, produced an extraordinary number of small copper alloy figurines from the end of the third millennium into the beginning of the first millennium BCE (5). Most of these figurines depict a standing male figure with left foot advancing and right arm raised in a position of smiting (6). Often the hands are pierced with holes to hold weapons or armor. These separate elements are preserved in a few examples, the most spectacular being a warrior holding a spear and shield found in a late thirteenth or early twelfth century BCE building at Enkomi on Cyprus (7). The figurines have a wide distribution, with examples found as far away as Greece, but the majority is concentrated along the Mediterranean coast of the Levant (8).   While the figurines share a common conceptual underpinning, the actual forms and styles of the small copper alloys display a remarkable range of diversity. In general, they appear to move along a spectrum from those that include a high degree of Egyptianizing elements, presumably produced in regions closer to Egypt, to those showing stronger affinities with the Hittite artistic tradition of central Turkey. Such stylistic features are evident in the shape and type of the tall crown, the form of the short skirt or kilt, and the proportions of the body. The basic iconography of the smiting figure is derived from the Egyptian image of Pharaoh defeating his enemies; yet, there is no exact parallel in Egypt, indicating a peculiarly Levantine iconographic conception. The figure most likely represents a deity, sometimes identified as either Baal or Reshep, two West Semitic gods. Although no definitive evidence exists to support these attributions, some examples have horns on their headdresses, which are a Near Eastern attribute of divinity (9). Where archaeological contexts are sufficiently well preserved, the figurines are clearly associated with cultic spaces. The largest group of excavated figurines comes from several locations in the temple complex at Byblos on the Lebanese coast, while another set was excavated in a Late Bronze Age temple complex at Kamid el-Loz in inland Lebanon (10). The precise dating of the figurines remains fraught for several reasons. First, many were hoarded and only buried well after their date of manufacture. Second, there is only poor information available, if there is any at all, on the provenience of a large portion of the figurines in museum collections. Finally, while the overall conception of the figurines unites them as a group, the diversity of individual features and styles often makes stylistic comparisons difficult.   NOTES:   1. O.

While close comparanda for this piece are lacking, a bronze warrior of unknown provenience and probably dating to the Late Bronze Age is one of the closest (ibid., no. 1311). This bronze, said to come from Syria, depicts a figure with a long dagger at the waist and a shield in the left hand. The objects both feature pierced semicircular ears, a modified White Crown, and the rendering of the raised right arm as a somewhat soft, rounded rod of metal with the clenched fist pierced to hold a weapon.

304309,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This handle curves upward and terminates in a female theatrical mask (4.4 cm high) set off by a ridge. The piece is broken just under the high point of the curve. The handle width tapers from 2.2 cm to 1.22 cm above the mask. The figure wears a horizontal cap with a roll of hair below it. Two ringlets fall on either side of the face, and under the chin there is a palmette, the tip of which is missing. On the underside is a hollow rectangular depression with rounded corners (1.14 x 1.87 cm).    The execution is summary, as though the piece were made from a much-used and worn model or mold. Although this type is well known in the first century BCE, the piece could have been made as late as the mid third century CE (1).   Lamp handles 1965.26 and 1969.177.25 represent a type that is well known from finds at Pompeii and Herculaneum and was popular throughout the Roman Empire from the late first century BCE into the third century CE (2). The bodies of the intact lamps are pear-shaped with a central fill hole and a rounded or splayed and fluked nozzle. The handles curve upward from the point of attachment on the side of the reservoir with the terminus over the center of the reservoir. The lamps were made to sit on a stand or tripod, to be suspended from chains, or to be held by the handle, which was usually cast separately from the body and attached with lead solder. The handles are D-shaped in section, and the undersides are very smooth.    NOTES:   1. The mask is closest to one on the handle of a complete lamp from Pompeii; see N.

304317,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Standing erect on a small, irregularly shaped base, this slim female figure formed the support of a now-lost mirror disc. The brace for the mirror is set on her head and worked as a unit with the flat, sickle-shaped wings rising from her shoulders. With the hands placed on the hips, the bent arms anticipate the curve of the wings and act as a crossbar to the straight lower body. Although the figure has all the qualities of a handle, it probably was originally equipped with a larger base and served as a stand.   Despite casting flaws, the caryatid was repaired and finished with traced and punched detail, most of which is restricted to the front. The figure wears a short-sleeved upper garment with a hatched collar, low belt, and oblique hem over a long, pleated chiton. The buttons along the sleeves are rendered as punched circles, and the front is decorated with rows of scales. Scales and hatching on the wings indicate feathers, punched circles embellish the border of the mirror cradle, and a zigzag ornament encircles the base. The reverse side of both the cradle and wings is plain. The wavy hair falls down the back in a cursorily rendered mass held by a fillet and subdivided into fourteen strands by vertical lines. The proper right ear is missing and indicated by an incision.   Following Egyptian models, such mirrors were first made in Laconia, where the caryatid usually took the form of a nude girl. An origin in South Italy (Magna Graecia) has been suggested for this early dressed example. However, there are no close parallels among bronzes commonly attributed to western workshops, and it may be more fruitful to emphasize those features that recall Corinthian works of the sixth century BCE: the slender body, the elongated face with slightly protruding, wide-set eyes and unsmiling mouth, and the hairstyle preserving elements of the Daedalic “wig” (1). The winged figure combines traits of anthropomorphic mirror handles with those of gorgon and sphinx vessel attachments; in fact, the arms placed akimbo and the peculiar upper garment echo depictions of gorgons (2). This caryatid has been thought to represent Nike but may also represent the goddess Artemis as mistress of animals, who is often shown winged during the Archaic period.   NOTES:   1. See K.

304318,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Although this seated man lacks his left foot and right leg below the knee, he projects an air of vigorous power and commanding presence. The right arm is outstretched to the side with its hand raised in a fist, as if meant to hold an upright scepter or weapon. The left arm bends at the elbow with the fist extended in front of the left side. Marked by horizontal divisions and pulled in at the waist, the abdomen ends in a prominent inguinal ridge terminating at the genitals. The chest muscles are broad, and there is a prominent, wide groove that marks the shoulder muscles on the right side. Well-proportioned in relation to the body, the man’s head turns slightly to his left; his hair rests in a cap-like mass on the crown of the head. The back edge of the figure’s cap-like hairdo projects outward and slightly upward. A close-cut pointed beard with well-defined upper edges and small mustache frames the lower part of his face, which has shallowly modeled oval-eyes and a small, pursed mouth. No visible traces of incised detail indicating strands on either the hair or beard survive. The underside of the buttocks is concave and clearly rested on a rounded, convex surface of some kind.    The commanding pose of this small figure, monumental despite its miniature scale, may indicate a deity, perhaps Zeus. There is a corresponding figure of a beardless youth from the Athenian Acropolis whose modeling and scale are virtually identical and whose underside is similarly concave. This statuette, in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens, suggests that the two may have been a pair, adorning the rim of some kind of large vessel or object, such as a tripod (1). The late K. Schefold had previously expressed the opinion that the statuette is Corinthian (2); however, this bronze and its counterpart in Athens could perfectly well be Athenian products of the period c. 510 to 490 BCE.

304335,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This cross-shaped pendant is equipped with a loop and was worn suspended from the neck. It is composed of two separately cast parts hinged together at the top and closed at the bottom with a removable pin. The pendant is hollow and probably contained a small relic; however, no trace of this sacred object remains. Given the modest character of the pendant, the relic was probably also of little material value, perhaps a small piece of cloth made holy through contact with a more significant relic or soaked with blessed oil (1). When worn, pendants like this one rested against the wearer’s chest; they are therefore commonly referred to as “pectoral” crosses.   The surfaces of the cross are decorated with crudely incised figures and inscriptions. On each side at the intersection of the arms, a bust-length, frontal figure raises its hand in prayer. These two figures, essentially indistinguishable from one another, are highly schematic. A rope-like medallion encircles each bust, and flourishes extend into each of the horizontal arms of the cross. In the lower vertical arm stands a winged figure representing an angel.    Although four figures appear on the cross, only three inscriptions are present. In the upper arm of the obverse is inscribed in three lines “Holy Theotokos” (literally, “God-Bearer,” an epithet of the Virgin Mary). A horizontal border, embellished with short vertical dashes and a small oval at the center, separates the inscription from the rest of the field. It has been suggested that the central bust represents the Virgin Mary (2), however the figure lacks any features to support this attribution, and the horizontal line disassociates the inscription from the figure. An inscription running vertically to the right and left of the angel on the obverse reads “Agios Petro(s)” (Saint Peter). The cramped appearance of the letters suggests the inscription was not part of the original design. At the top of the upper arm on the reverse is inscribed “Archestratego(s),” a title accorded to Archangel Michael, the general (strategos in Greek) of the heavenly armies (3). This label is more fitting, however, for the winged figure in the lower section of each side. Like the inscription in the upper arm of the obverse, the letters here are arranged in three lines, but are less regular in execution and are not separated from the field.    B. Pitarakis identifies the figure appearing at the center of the cross on each side as Christ Pantocrator (the “All-Ruling”) and interprets the square object at the center of the figure’s chest to be a book (representing the Word of God), an attribute of the Pantocrator (4); however, the figure’s hands, which are raised in an orant (prayer) position, are not consistent with the iconography of the Pantocrator, who typically raises a single hand in a gesture of blessing (5). Alternately, the two sides of the cross may be understood to depict the same holy individuals twice, with Saint Peter in the central medallion at the crossing of the arms and Archangel Michael below (6). In either case, the inscription referring to the Virgin Mary should be read as an invocation of the Holy Mother rather than a label for one of the depicted figures. Regardless of their identity, the four figures serve as intercessors on behalf of the owner. Together with the sacred relic inside the container, they imbued the amulet with protective power (7).    The relatively humble material and unrefined decoration of the pendant indicate that it was made for a non-elite owner (8). Modest cross-pendant reliquaries similar to the Harvard example are found in large numbers throughout regions of the former Byzantine Empire, suggesting that they were mass produced (9). The ambiguity of the inscriptions raises the possibility that the cross was initially decorated with generic holy figures, who were later designated with the names of specific saints, perhaps at the request of a buyer. Based presumably on comparison with other middle Byzantine engraved pectoral crosses, Pitarakis dates the Harvard piece to the eleventh century and attributes it to a workshop in Constantinople or Anatolia (10).

While this shell could be a votive object (1), an appliqué, or even the foot of a vessel, its solid form is best explained as a weight.

304357,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"These well-modeled but fairly worn leonine paws were probably attached to the base of a cista (a small container or box). Bronze feet of this type were mass-produced in antiquity; thus, although 1932.56.4.A and 1932.56.4.B differ slightly, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that they came from the same vessel. Part of the vessel to which 1932.56.4.A was attached still adheres to this foot. Where it was wrenched (or corroded) away from its vessel, there remain two thin sheets of metal, indicating the point of attachment.   The claws are retracted, while other types of this fixture have articulated and “sprung” claws. Both types of claws are seen on Etruscan bronze pieces, specifically those with utilitarian purposes, such as incense burners or lamps where the feet form part of the base. On the latter, the foot is generally placed atop a bronze disc, plinth, or square, perhaps to stabilize the lamp. The absence of this additional piece suggests that these feet were probably part of a cista. This is substantiated by their small size, as well as the absence of an “ankle” that curves up from the foot to form part of the supporting base, which is a standard feature of these decorative feet on larger vessels.

304359,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This figurine originally constituted the upper part of a portable lampstand. The monkey stands upright on its hind legs and holds a sword in its forepaws. Its facial features are incised with two parallel lines for each of the eyes, a triangle for the nose, and a wide curve for the mouth. The figure is broken at the ankles and tail. The sword served as a pricket (holding spike) for a lamp; the lamp would have been formed with a hole in its bottom into which the pricket would fit, thereby allowing it to be held securely (see 1975.41.141.A-C). The monkey was originally attached to either a pedestal base or a collapsible, interlocking stand (1). A comparable sixth- to seventh-century example representing a man carrying a sword preserves its lamp, which is c. 7.62 cm long and provides an approximate size for the lamp used with this pricket (2).   The monkey is unique among preserved lampstand figurines. In all other examples, the lamp carrier is a human figure, such as a naked Dionysos carrying grapes, nude athletes, or cloaked men, presumably servants or guards (3). Although the provenance for the Harvard pricket is undocumented, other figural lampstands come from the eastern Mediterranean—Egypt, Syria, and Constantinople—and the closest stylistic parallels are dated to the sixth to seventh centuries (4).

304372,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This small angular falcon wears no headdress; its large feet stand on a thin rectangular base. Randomly positioned circular indentations indicate the feathers on the wings and head.   The soaring flight and predatory character of the falcon linked the mighty raptor to the god of the living king, Horus, early in the pharaonic tradition. The living king of Egypt was identified as an earthly Horus, and from the late Predynastic Period (c. 3100 BCE), the king bore a special royal “Horus name.” The falcon, as the sacred animal of Horus, came to symbolize divine kingship, as the king was the earthly representation of Horus. The common appearance of the Double Crown and uraeus on bronze figurines of falcons reinforces this royal connection. The falcon was also associated with the sky, with its eyes representing the sun and the moon and its large wings outspread to protect the earth below. Later, the falcon became associated with the sun god Re, bearing a sun disc on its head (known as Re-Harakhty). Other gods also had falcons as their sacred animals, such as Montu the god of war, who is distinguished by a double-plume headdress.   As with so many animals associated with the divine realm, during the later periods the falcon became the focus of mummification, burial, and votive offerings. The numerous bronze falcon statuettes are characterized by their upright, yet resting, stance with wings folded at the side. They range in size from small ornaments to large, freestanding figures. Many of the larger examples, such as 1943.1118, were hollow-cast with an inner compartment in which an actual bird could be deposited. Hundreds of thousands of mummified falcons were buried in extensive catacombs at sacred sites throughout Egypt. The Greco-Roman period temples at Philae and Edfu represent the final flourishing of the cult. The more elaborately decorated figures include engraved and inlaid detailing of the feathers and facial markings. The facial patterning, seen on 1943.1118, 1957.165, and 1957.166, follows the conventions established early on with the feathered eye and moustachial stripe. Although the representation of falcons remained constant throughout Egyptian history, it is not zoologically accurate and cannot be identified with any particular species (1).   NOTES:   1.

The simple frame, which has the same dimensions and layout as the more elaborately decorated intarsia panels, may have been intended to provide guidelines for creating a similar egg-and-dart and lesbian cymatium border. One half of the surviving panel is completely undecorated; the other has a simple raised beveled frame on three sides with the lines unevenly placed. One long side of the frame has a third section, which corresponds to an undecorated border on the lesbian cymatium decorated sides of the other intarsia panels. Guidelines extend from the frame into the unframed field, as seen on 1992.318, 1992.319, and 1992.321.   These fragmentary panels would have been placed in a decorative band around the sides of a Roman couch (kline) or table. Based on similarities in decoration and method of manufacture, they may all have been created in a single workshop or by one craftsman. The molded frames are the same on five of the six objects, while the sixth is unfinished.   A first-century CE panel very similar to two of Harvard’s panels (1992.316 and 1992.320) was among the large hoard of bronzes found in the excavations of the Basilica of Bavay, France, in 1969 (1). The burial of the hoard is dated to the fourth century CE, but the makeup of the hoard (statuettes, instrumenta, and scraps) as well as the presence of earlier items, such as the Bavay furniture panel and a Hellenistic Eros, indicates that the items were assembled from many sources and were perhaps going to be melted down (2).   The decoration of grape vines, leaves, and clusters, alluding to wine, are seen on two of the panels (1992.316 and 1992.320) and would have been appropriate decoration for Roman couches, which often bore images of Dionysus and his entourage (3). The couches were used for dining or sleeping, a motif often referenced in Dionysiac imagery.   NOTES:   1. S. Boucher and H.

The house cat, as the domesticated counterpart to the wild feline, especially the lion, appears in Egyptian art at least as early as the Middle Kingdom (c. 2134-1665 BCE). The male, or tomcat, was associated with the sun god, and in the New Kingdom (c. 1571-1076 BCE) played an important role in the Book of the Dead as the slayer of the Apophis serpent, enemy of the sun god. In all likelihood, however, the bronze statuettes represent the female cat and are connected with a series of goddesses, in particular Bastet.   Bastet was an ancient goddess, known from at least the beginning of the Old Kingdom (c. 2687-2191 BCE). She and several other goddesses associated with the solar element were represented as feline-headed. Over time, she acquired the more benevolent characteristics of the domesticated cat, known for its fertility and nocturnal sex life, in opposition to the more threatening leonine aspects assumed by the goddess Sekhmet. In this role, Bastet and, by extension, cats were seen to be peaceful and protective. While there were other goddesses who manifested themselves as cats, for example Pakhet (“She Who Scratches”) in Middle Egypt, Bastet’s supremacy rose during the first millennium, probably as a direct result of her connection to the rulers of Dynasty 22 (c. 931-725 BCE) who came from Bubastis, the ancient cult center of Bastet.    Bubastis (modern Tell Basta near Zagazig in the eastern Delta), in addition to other Egyptian sites, became the site of a large cat cemetery at the temple of Bastet, in which mummified cats were deposited as votives. Skeletal evidence suggests that the mummified cats had been intentionally killed while still young, rather than having been cherished pets that died of natural causes (3). Small cat figurines were often wrapped in the linen bandages of the mummified remains, which were in turn placed in bronze or wooden containers in the shape of seated cats. Many of the larger, hollow-cast bronze cats can be interpreted in this way and retain an opening into the body cavity. The majority of the bronzes, however, were dedicated in shrines.   The dedication of cat mummies and votive statues has been connected to a highly institutionalized cult of the king, which may explain the large number and standardized iconography of the bronzes (4). Although there is a wide variety of types preserved, most of the bronzes achieve an anatomical correctness and express the essence of cats—haughty dignity and aloofness.

Its tubular rump is elongated and thickens toward the hindquarters and a stumpy tail. The flat, high-curved neck is set off sharply from the body; there is no detail on the head except for the two alert ears. The stick-like legs recall animals figurines of the late second and early first millennia BCE from the province of Gilan (see 1978.505 and 1978.506). However, the defined geometrical forms link this and related horse-shaped pendants more closely to a series of cosmetic sticks with animal finials, such as 1995.1144, which seem to have been used in the same area of northern Iran at a later point, perhaps in the Parthian period (1).

304476,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This bronze mirror has a worn beaded border surrounding the disc. Traces of volutes survive on the extension, which would have been inserted into a handle.   There are ten Etruscan bronze mirrors in the collection of the Harvard Art Museums, ranging in date from the early fifth century to the mid second century BCE. All the mirrors bear engraved designs, and the more elaborately decorated medallions contain scenes involving human or divine figures. Identifiable subjects include a seated Hermes and Lasa (1932.56.38), as well as two young men wearing short chitons and Phrygian caps on 1932.56.37, who may be the Dioskouroi (1). The subjects depicted on other mirrors are more difficult to identify with certainty. One such example is a scene depicting two young men flanking two women, one of whom is nude, in front of an architectural structure (1977.216.1995.A-B); it has been suggested that the figures may be Helen, Clytemnestra, and the Dioskouroi (2). Another scene, less well preserved, shows a figure wearing a peplos and helmet flanked on the left by a man in a short tunic and boots, and on the right by an unidentified woman wearing a peplos and Phrygian cap (1977.216.2311). The central figure is most likely Athena (Etruscan Menrva), and while the figure on the left leans on a club similar to the one often carried by Herakles, it is unusual for that hero to be shown clothed (3). The three stand before a two-story Ionic structure.   Two mirrors in the collection show signs of an interesting afterlife. The disc of 1977.216.2311 has been perforated in ten places, probably as a means of ensuring that the object would be useless to the living and could be permanently dedicated to the deceased; a less plausible suggestion is that the mirror was reused as a strainer (4). Another mirror in the collection (1977.216.3422), if it is ancient, seems to have been reworked in modern times by an engraver who added to the medallion a female bust, a recumbent male, and an inscription. Neither the style nor the subject of the engraving corresponds to examples known from other Etruscan mirrors, and both the engraving and the inscription appear to have been made with a modern instrument (5).

She holds out thick tresses of hair from either side of her head as if removing the sea-foam. Her pose is based upon a version of a famous Hellenistic statue, which in turn may have been inspired by the image of an Aphrodite Anadyomene—emerging from the sea and wringing out her hair—painted by Apelles, a fourth century BCE Greek painter who may also be credited with creating the type (1). Two variants of the sculpture are known: nude and partially draped. Bronze statuettes of the Aphrodite Anadyomene type were popular in the Roman provinces and are also known from Turkey. While inspired by masterworks, this bronze example of Aphrodite is not of high aesthetic quality and was likely part of a mass-produced casting that made votives intended as dedications in sanctuaries of the goddess or as inexpensive figures for placement in a tomb or household shrine (2).

The base of the rectangular body protrudes at a right angle to form the feet.   Thousands of small, anthropomorphic copper alloy statuettes and anatomical votives have been recovered from remote sanctuary sites in south-central Spain, particularly Collado de los Jardines and Castellar de Santisteban, but it is not certain to which god or gods they were dedicated (2). Many of the statuettes depict individuals, some of whom are represented in poses of prayer or offering (3). Some are very abstract and schematically rendered, while others wear identifiable contemporary clothing (4). Abstract votive figures like this example begin to be produced in the fourth century BCE to supply an ever-increasing number of worshippers with relatively inexpensive offerings.

The entirety was hollow cast as a single piece. The shape of the base, popular for such cat statuettes, may derive from the counterpoise of the menat necklace. The necklace was initially associated with the goddess Hathor, but later also with a series of feline goddesses including Sekhmet and Bastet. From the Ramesside period (19th and 20th Dynasties, c. 1321-1076 BCE) onward, it served as an amuletic grave offering, acquiring a protective and regenerative function. One of the few securely dated examples of a seated cat statue, based on an inscription bearing the cartouche of Psamtik I (Dynasty 26, c. 664-610 BCE), rests on such a base (1).   The seated cat was the most popular animal depicted in bronze during the first millennium BCE and accompanied the increasingly widespread recognition of sacred animal cults from the Late Period through the Ptolemaic (664-30 BCE) (2). The house cat, as the domesticated counterpart to the wild feline, especially the lion, appears in Egyptian art at least as early as the Middle Kingdom (c. 2134-1665 BCE).

The head and antlers are schematized, the muzzle having a diamond-shaped cross-section and the antlers forming a squared, four-pronged array; the tail is a simple triangular protrusion. A small suspension loop emerges from its back where the neck meets the shoulders. The slender legs are held tightly together on a small, irregularly shaped flat base. Two small and two larger round holes are punched in the center of the base, possibly for attachment to a larger item.

These figurines display a wide range of styles and quality. Many of them bear suspension loops on their back, or, in the case of two stags from Marlik in Iran, are pierced through the front shoulders.

304599,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The band of this ring has a bezel on one side and a narrow bar on the other. The shaft of the separately cast, solid-barrel key was bent around the bar of the ring, allowing the key to swivel. The key is of a type known as a “turning key,” which was inserted into a lock device and then rotated to release a bolt. A properly sized and shaped bit was required to enter the hole of the lock and engage the bolt. The small size of this key indicates that it was probably used to secure a box or small chest (1).    The bezel on the opposite end of the band is incised with an “X” and could have been used as a sealing device. As insurance against petty theft, wax, clay, or another impressionable material could be laid over the seam of the box lid and then stamped with the bezel of the ring. If the seal was disturbed, the owner knew that someone had tampered with the box (2). Among extant Byzantine keys, only those in precious metal possess personalized seals; base metal rings, such as the Harvard example, were mass produced, and their bezels display generic, anonymous motifs (3).   When the ring was slipped over the wearer’s finger, the key twisted around to rest in the palm of the hand. The band of this ring is large, which may indicate that the ring was used by a man. But rings with swivel keys were not necessarily worn; some were instead suspended from chains, in which case the size of the ring has no bearing on the identity of the owner (4). The Harvard key is decorated on the shaft and band with pairs of incised perpendicular and diagonal lines. Similar decoration is found on keys of comparable shape dating from the fifth to seventh centuries CE, as well as on tenth- to twelfth-century keys from excavations at Corinth (5). Byzantine keys do not demonstrate a clear typological development over the centuries. Therefore, the Harvard piece may date from the fifth to twelfth centuries CE.   NOTES:   1. G. Vikan and J.

The conch-shaped lid is joined to the body by a pin. The cruciform handle consists of a flared-arm cross handle, a finger ring, and a reinforcing bar connecting the cross and ring. The base of each arm of the cross is inscribed with a short line emphasizing the separation of the arms. A large number of similar lamps are preserved; they are dated from the fifth to seventh centuries and have been found in Romania, Syria, Istanbul, Greece, Germany, and Egypt (1).   Each of Harvard’s Byzantine lamps consists of a bulbous body, spout, lid, and handle. The central cavity held oil that provided the fuel for the wick in the spout. Most of these examples were pierced at their base by a tapering rectangular indentation rising through the central cavity to receive the pricket of a stand. Although some lamps could be hung from above, all lamps in this group lack suspension rings. Instead, they were placed on a table or a stand (such as 1975.41.141.A-C). The basic form of the reservoir, handle, and spout derives from ancient Greek and Roman types, with some examples dating probably as early as the third millennium BCE.   Lamps were widely used during the Byzantine period in both sacred and profane settings. In the Christian liturgical context, lamps functioned as votive offerings, processional objects, funerary accoutrements, and lighting devices for worship. Similarly, lighting was an important component of imperial ceremonial. The use of lamps in magical rituals is also attested during the early Byzantine period (2). Many homilies and theological essays of the Byzantine period ascribe symbolic significance to lamps, for example, as metaphors for the soul (3). In the household, lamps were primarily used for illumination of domestic space, but they could also play a role in private devotional practices (4). Excavations such as those in Cyprus show that together with a table and couch, lamps were the most common household furnishing until candles largely replaced lamps by the seventh century (5).    Byzantine lamps range from strictly utilitarian examples to elaborately adorned vessels accented with crosses, animals, and precious stones. The cross and shell embellishments found in these examples mix religious and classical motifs. Clay lamps were the least expensive and most widespread, while bronze and silver appeared in aristocratic households and ecclesiastical settings (6).         NOTES:    1. Compare D. E.

Its square cross section, however, distinguishes it from the usual spearheads, which have two fins placed at one hundred eighty degrees on either side of a central socket. The four-sided point tapers to the tang (5.0 cm long) at one end, which has a chisel-like tip.    While there are no exact parallels among the published bronze weapon heads from Olympia, examination of Greek helmets and body armor sometimes reveals square punctures that appear to have been inflicted by similar points. However, the large number of similar objects from the citadel and lower city of Hattusa (Boğazköy, Turkey) make it virtually certain that this object dates to the Hittite Empire, c. 1500-1200 BCE (1).

304637,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The bird rests its feet and tail on a small oval base. The figurine and base were cast together. The claws are strong, heavy, and somewhat paw-like, with the right slightly bigger than the left. Short parallel incisions decorate the top of the head, neck, and claws; longer deep incisions articulate feathers on the tail. There is a triangular depression behind each eye, perhaps made by pincers. The schematic surface decoration suggests a late Roman or early Byzantine date.   A protrusion from the bottom of the base could be either a remnant from the casting process or a tang used to attach the eagle to another object. In the Late Roman period, eagles and other birds commonly adorned bronze vessels and lamps (1). Alternatively, the relatively large rectangular base might have been attached to a pedestal, equipping the eagle to serve as a votive statuette. Miniature eagles secured on pedestal bases were likely placed in a household or other type of shrine; a bronze eagle served as a votive offering at the Sanctuary of Diana at Nemi (2). In antiquity, the religious significance of the eagle stemmed from its association with Zeus (Roman Jupiter). As an imperial token, it symbolized victory and rulership. The eagle also accompanied emperors’ souls to heaven (3). In the early Byzantine period, eagles were rendered in bronze, ivory, and ceramic as an imperial and consular emblem of authority and possibly a more general sign of good fortune (4).  NOTES:   1.

He looks downward and to his left with his left arm and leg extended, while what remains of his right leg is drawn back. His right arm, now mostly missing, would have been raised. The twisted pose adds a rhythm and liveliness to the bronze statuette (1).   As a god of love, Eros had his own ancient cult as well as individual worshipers. He was also celebrated in older Greek fertility cults and jointly with Aphrodite at her sanctuary on the north slope of the Athenian Acropolis. Eros directed his attentions to male as well as female beauty, and his images were also placed in gymnasia. During the Classical period, Eros is increasingly associated with the world of women in domestic scenes or at weddings. By Roman times, he is ubiquitous in the decorative arts, often in the form of an endearing and playful child, like this small figure, who likely adorned a bronze vessel as an appliqué or handle attachment (2).

There are round hammer marks around the springs. The surface of the wire leading to the catchplate has a single groove running with the axis. The tip of the catchplate is missing. There are bends and distortions in the pin. The surface has green corrosion and thick burial accretions overall.   The serpentine fibula has an elegant form that consists of a single length of wire formed into a crescent-shaped fastener for clothing. One end of the wire has been sharpened into a point to puncture the cloth, while the opposite end has been shaped into a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin. Two single springs incorporated into the wire apply tension between the catchplate and pin. The section between the springs, called the bow, curves in harmony with the arch of the pin. There are nineteen serpentine fibulae in the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, and these fibulae have minor stylistic variations in form and decoration. They have no known provenience; however, serpentine fibulae were common during the Iron Age, and they are found distributed throughout Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and France (1).    The serpentine type of fibula is considered to have descended from the Late Bronze Age violin-bow type, which has a straight pin and a single spring. Replacing the violin-bow, the serpentine fibulae came into general use during the Early Iron Age, and the type continued to be used throughout the next half century. During this time, communities created their own types of fibulae, and discrete variations in the form developed. Trade in Italy during the eighth century BCE contributed to the spread of provincial styles; as a result, the traceability of their origins has been complicated. Serpentine fibulae were common in Sicily during Greek colonization, hence the type has also been termed “Sicilian” (2). Changes in the form have been used to date serpentine fibulae, the earliest of which have a flattened spiral catchplate. As the Iron Age progressed, the catchplate developed into a simple, folded channel, which became longer over time (3). 1987.135.53 and 1987.135.40 have the longest catchplates in the collection and probably date to the Late Iron Age, while the remaining fibulae with shorter catchplates are most likely from the Early Iron Age. Some of the fibulae in the Harvard collection have incised decorations, including 1987.135.38, which bears a herringbone pattern partially obscured by corrosion (4). Inscribed, consecutive parallel line patterns, similar to the ones on 1987.135.51, have been found on serpentine fibulae in central Italy (5).    NOTES:   1. Compare serpentine fibulae in J.

The handle consists of a large, irregular ring attached to the back of the stamp plate. There appears to be a type of twisted decoration on the top of the ring.    The stamp reads: ILECENI AELVI   “Of Ilecenus Aelius.”   The text of 1978.495.33 is not as immediately legible as others in the Harvard collection. The N of the first line is reversed. The A of the second line does not have a horizontal crossbar. The final letter of the first line may be an I, but it may also be a different type of symbol. “Aelius” is a common gentilicium; it was part of Hadrian’s name and was then adopted by individuals who were either manumitted or given Roman citizenship by Hadrian. The genitive of this name, however, would be “Aeli.” “Ilecenus” is a rare name, if indeed it was one (1).   Each of the six Roman bronze stamps in the Harvard Art Museums consists of a plate, on which the die of the stamp is carved, and a ring, attached to the back of the plate, which serves as a handle for applying the stamp (2). With the exception of 1977.216.3250, Harvard’s stamps are approximately the same size (c. 5-6 cm long and 2-3 cm wide), and all are inscribed with text. Stamps were produced in a variety of shapes. Most are rectangular, but they could also be elliptical, circular, rhomboid, or in the shape of a tabella ansata, a foot, or, less commonly, a hand. Five of the six stamps in the Harvard Art Museums are rectangular. Four of these have two lines of writing inscribed on them; one other rectangular stamp contains a single line of text, which is limited to initials. The sixth stamp, 1977.216.1963, takes the shape of a foot and also has only one line of writing. This stamp appears to contain pseudo-alphabetic characters. Four others are inscribed in Latin, with the lettering raised and written backwards, a mirror image of the text the stamp would produce. 1977.216.3250 is inscribed in Greek letters but not written retrograde, meaning that the stamp’s impression would have been backwards.   Many types of objects in the ancient world bore stamped impressions, including amphorae, roof tiles, bricks, lamps, glass vessels, and terra sigillata (fine pottery). Textiles and bread were also sometimes stamped, and stamps like Harvard’s may have been used for such a purpose (3). Roof tiles and bricks were being stamped in Greece as early as the Archaic period. In the West, the earliest evidence for stamps comes from amphorae dated from the end of the fourth to the beginning of the third centuries BCE (4).   The texts of stamps most often refer to the name of the producer or manufacturer of the product in the genitive case (e.g., 1978.495.34 “of Cossinus Eutychianus”). In certain instances, the name is written using ligatures or abbreviations. Other stamps include an image such as a leaf (hedera) or an abstract pattern, while some stamps have writing in what seems to be an imitation of alphabetic characters, although it is clearly not Latin or Greek (5). In these cases, where the recipients of such goods were most likely illiterate, the presence of a stamp on the object may have sufficed to guarantee a certain level of quality. Stamps could have varying degrees of decoration along the border and may or may not have a horizontal element to divide separate lines of text (6). The extent a stamp was used varied according to workshop; certain workshops continued to use their stamps until the writing was no longer legible before replacing them (7).   NOTES:   1.

The interior rim is thickened, and the inside of the vessel is densely covered with fine, concentric lines around a centering mark. A corresponding mark on the outside confirms that the bowl was finished on a lathe. A hole (c. 0.5 cm in diameter) was punched just below the thickened rim. This hole is worn along its vertical axis, suggesting that some kind of handle was attached here and that the vessel was in use for a period of time prior to deposition in the grave (1). On the exterior, there is a faint textile pseudomorph to the left of the hole (2).   The bowl was found together with a small pottery jug and cup as well as several beads in a plundered grave at Gammai near the northern border of modern Sudan. The grave consisted of a trench with the burial placed in an undercut side chamber. Similar, often deeper, bronze bowls bearing lathe-turned and various other kinds of decoration, and in a few cases equipped with a ring handle, were common during the late and post-Meroitic periods, the time of the Ballana Culture (also known as the “X-Group”) in Lower Nubia.

310614,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"These well-modeled but fairly worn leonine paws were probably attached to the base of a cista (a small container or box). Bronze feet of this type were mass-produced in antiquity; thus, although 1932.56.4.A and 1932.56.4.B differ slightly, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that they came from the same vessel. Part of the vessel to which 1932.56.4.A was attached still adheres to that foot. Where it was wrenched (or corroded) away from its vessel, there remain two thin sheets of metal, indicating the point of attachment.   The claws are retracted, while other types of this fixture have articulated and “sprung” claws. Both types of claws are seen on Etruscan bronze pieces, specifically those with utilitarian purposes, such as incense burners or lamps where the feet form part of the base. On the latter, the foot is generally placed atop a bronze disc, plinth, or square, perhaps to stabilize the lamp. The absence of this additional piece suggests that these feet were probably part of a cista. This is substantiated by their small size, as well as the absence of an “ankle” that curves up from the foot to form part of the supporting base, which is a standard feature of these decorative feet on larger vessels.

He is smiling lasciviously, flipping his tail, and snapping his fingers. This exuberant dance belongs to the world of Dionysos, evoking a rural, untamed life. The original statuette has been called the finest bronze ever found at Pompeii. Because of this, some argue that it is based on a Greek original, with the dates assigned to that copy or to the Greek original ranging from 300 to 100 BCE (1). The house itself, whose interior décor included the faun, was destroyed in 79 CE by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius.   The first version of this dancing faun was discovered in October 1830, installed in the middle of an impluvium, the pool in the atrium, of a Pompeiian house that filled an entire city block. The house was named the House of the Faun (Pompeii VI.12.2) after the statuette (2), which, much like the great Alexander Mosaic from the same house, immediately became famous.    In 1860, under Victor Emmanuel II, the antiquities from Pompeii were put on view for the general public in the National Archaeological Museum at Naples. Permits for taking molds from antiquities in order to copy them were soon granted to various individuals and institutions. The reproductions that these enterprises offered were often reduced in scale, making them easy for Grand Tourists to take home to northern Europe, Britain, or America. This statuette is surely a souvenir of the Grand Tour.    NOTES:   1. For the original faun, see F. Haskell and N. Penny, Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture, 1500-1900 (New Haven, 1981) 208-209, no. 35.   2. Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples, inv. no. 5002; h. 71 cm.

His face is poorly preserved, but under the corrosion, it is possible to make out almond-shaped eyes with horizontal lines separating the lids. He has a protruding triangular nose, and a small incision for the mouth may be visible above the small, round chin. The neck is rather wide and flat, leading to the sloping shoulders and flat torso. The man stands with one hand raised palm outward in salute (the thumb is missing) with the other hand held palm outward, fingers down at his waist level. The hand at his waist probably once held out an offering. Fingers are indicated on each hand but not separated (1). The upper arms are fused to the torso. He wears a short V-neck tunic with a belt around his narrow waist (2). The belt is prominent and square in front, but it is represented only by incised lines in the back. The legs are rounded, giving some indication of musculature, particularly around the calf muscles. The man appears to be barefoot. Toes are indicated by incised lines, and the heels are pointed. With the exception of the belt, the back is essentially featureless.   Thousands of small, anthropomorphic copper alloy statuettes and anatomical votives have been recovered from remote sanctuary sites in south-central Spain, particularly Collado de los Jardines and Castellar de Santisteban, but it is not certain to which god or gods they were dedicated (3). Many of the statuettes depict individuals, some of whom are represented in poses of prayer or offering (4). Some are very abstract and schematically rendered, while others wear identifiable contemporary clothing (5). In spite of the similarity of the votives, there is nothing to indicate that the intention behind each offering was the same. This example is most likely from the cave sanctuary of Collado de los Jardines near Santa Elena, Jaén. It was given to Harvard in 1933 by the Republic of Spain in exchange for the cover of the eleventh-century sarcophagus of Alfonso Ansúrez from Sahagún, León, which was then in the collection of the Fogg Art Museum (6).

He remarks that another geographer, Ephorus, extended the boundaries of the Celts too far and included the Iberians, and then he notes that these people “take great care not to become too fat or big-bellied, and that if any young man exceeds the measure of a certain girdle, he is punished” (Strabo, 4.4.6). Despite the confusion about whether this anecdote refers to the Celts or the Iberians, this detail appears to correspond to the account of Nicholas and is illustrated by the attire of statuettes like this one.   3.

It was given to Harvard in 1933 by the Republic of Spain in exchange for the cover of the eleventh-century sarcophagus of Alfonso Ansúrez from Sahagún, León, which was then in the collection of the Fogg Art Museum (6).

The first-century BCE geographer Strabo describes the large disc-like decorations as “drums” (tymphanum) that spiral outward, increasing in height and width, covering part of the head down to the ears. (Strabo, 3.4.17). He mentions that some of the women twist their hair around a rod and cover it in a black veil, which seems to correspond to the pointed headdresses seen on this statuette and 1978.507. Compare the large and elaborate wheel-like discs on the side of the head and pointed headdress of the stone bust known as the Lady of Elche (Museo Arqueológico Nacional, Madrid, inv. no. 1971/10/1) with these details on the two Harvard statuettes. See also the Iberian stone heads from sanctuary at Cerro de los Santos with high pointed headdresses similar to Harvard’s bronzes in the Museo de Albacete, inv. nos.

Sandars, “Pre-Roman Bronze Votive Offerings from Despeñaperros, in Sierra Morena, Spain,” Archaeologia, or Miscellaneous Tracts Relating to Antiquity 10 (1906) 69-92.   3. An epitome describing the Iberians preserved from Nicholas of Damascus’ universal history notes that the Iberians had a belt of a certain size, and it was considered unseemly if anyone could not fit in it; see Nicolai Damasceni Historiarum excerpta et fragmenta quae supersunt Graece (Lipsiae/Leipzig, 1804) 142-45 “Iberi/Ιβηροι.” Strabo has a longer description of this custom. He remarks that another geographer, Ephorus, extended the boundaries of the Celts too far and included the Iberians, and then he notes that these people “take great care not to become too fat or big-bellied, and that if any young man exceeds the measure of a certain girdle, he is punished” (Strabo, 4.4.6). Despite the confusion about whether this anecdote refers to the Celts or the Iberians, this detail appears to correspond to the account of Nicholas and is illustrated by the attire of statuettes like this one.   4.

311070,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This panther has the look of a kitten rather than that of a deadly predator. The main features that identify it as a panther are a dramatically convex back that puts the haunches higher than the head, a raised-head stance with mouth slightly open, paws that are placed together with wide grooves denoting claws, a snubbed nose, no ruff or mane, and small ears flattened against the head. Like 1955.120, it appears the panther was designed to decorate a flat surface. However, the piece comes with an enigmatic feature: its tail, which has been broken off, originally continued beneath the figure to a finished point. The reason for this is perplexing, as this carefully rendered detail would not have been visible once the panther was fixed to a surface. Such an enigma begs an unanswerable question: Was this an example of fastidious craftsmanship or a clue to the piece’s originally intended function?    Exact parallels for 1955.120 and 1952.18 have been difficult to find, making it challenging to place the pieces chronologically.   NOTES:   1. Compare A.

311071,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The arched bow and most of the catchplate are preserved. The bow, convex on top and concave underneath, meets the paper-thin, rectangular catchplate at two perpendicular planes. Ovoid beads, with raised rings above and below, mark the transitions between the bow and the catchplate on one side, and the pin, now missing, on the other. The top surface of the bow features a network of precisely cut lines, perhaps cast and then enhanced by incision. Double borders, with the outermost being more shallow, define its contours, and a spine of five lines, the two outermost being deeper than the interior three, run the length of the bow. Both sides of the catchplate bear figural decoration that was incised after casting. Although the fibula is said to be from Thessaly (1), the type has also been associated repeatedly with Boeotia (2). Attic examples seem to disappear c. 750 BCE.   Side A shows three stacked fish facing left within a border of three lines, overlapping semicircles, followed by double lines (3). A triangle in the upper left corner is filled with diagonal lines and crossed zigzags. Side B has a very similar border and filled triangle in the upper right corner. Inside, an animated, tethered horse is combined with two birds, one floating above facing right, and the other standing under the horse facing left. The horse is pictured with its hindquarters in profile and its head and front legs as from the front. The bird underneath the horse touches the animal’s belly with its beak, and the tether trailing from the horse’s muzzle is connected to a rectangular object (4).    The catchplate’s decoration appears to use the horse, bird, and fish to stand for basic elemental divisions. The opposing sides of the catchplate make possible a separation of the two primary temporal elements, land and water, symbolized by the horse and fish respectively. Birds represent air and the heavens, and they commune between land and water. The eighth-century BCE Boeotian epic poet Hesiod expressed an analogous tripartite partitioning in the Theogony; a complementary cosmography is presented on the shield of Achilles in Homer’s Iliad 18 and on the shield of Herakles in Hesiod’s Aspis Herakleous, where the circle of Okeanos defines the outer perimeter of the world. The fibula suggests that a parallel interest in sectioning the visible universe would have been shared by its maker and appreciated by its owner, since it was worn in life and either buried with the owner or dedicated to the deathless gods (5).

311072,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A sturdy, draped man stands frontally, his feet placed squarely beside each other. His right hand reaches downward diagonally, clasping a slender staff through his perforated fist. His left arm, slightly bent, is covered by the long cloak or himation that he wears over that shoulder. Its edge is fringed with short diagonal incisions, as is the upper hem of the garment, and the fringe extends around under his right arm. His garment hangs to just below his ankles. His face is broad, with a large mouth and pronounced lower lip, and has enlarged oval eyes with incised pupils. The right nipple is marked by a small circle similar to those that form his pupils. The featureless feet suggest that he is wearing boots or low shoes.   His hair falls in a mass below his shoulders down his back. Two narrow strands, marked by short diagonal incised grooves, fall down his shoulders to his chest. His short beard is defined by vertical incisions. His forehead is bordered by a rounded mass of hair with diagonal incisions on either side of a central part. The crown of his head is defined by incisions radiating outward that seem to pass under a raised convex hairband or fillet, marked by tiny notches or punctate marks. When seen in profile, the hair and the fillet flow directly into each other, which might suggest that the bronze caster who finished this statuette originally intended the man to wear a low leather cap, or pilos, which he then changed into the hair and fillet combination seen now.    This statuette is one of the finest, most individualized of a group of bronze statuettes found in and around the sanctuary of Zeus on Mount Lykaion in western Arcadia during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (1). Most of these statuettes, with their heavy overcoats, laced boots, and high conical caps, probably represent shepherds. The Harvard statuette is unusual for its costume, coiffure, and staff. These traits raise interesting questions about whether it was meant to represent a priest, a magistrate, or even a god. Whatever its identity, its monumental stillness and inner spirit reveal it as the work of an original Late Archaic master sculptor.   NOTES:   1. For a general discussion, see F.

311073,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The diminutive bull and the shape of the cymbal are a fine example of the advanced metallurgical skills of the people who lived in central Anatolia during the third millennium BCE. Despite its small size, the bull preserves distinctive Anatolian features such as the forward thrust of the two curving horns, the slight dip in the back that rises to the rear haunches and shoulder, the short tail, and the blunted end of the muzzle. Comparable elements are found on a group of well-known bronze bull and stag standards found in lavish burials of the mid to late third millennium BCE at Alaca Höyük and Horoztepe in central Turkey (1). Both bulls and stags play a prominent role in the little understood cultic rites of early Anatolia, and bull bucrania were included in the burials at Alaca Höyük. Alongside the elaborate standards, many of which include moving bronze pieces to create a rattle effect, were bronze cymbals of the same shape as the Harvard example (2). At Alaca Höyük they were found in pairs, as one would expect if they were used like castanets. A hole runs through the center of the rounded top of the Harvard cymbal, perhaps to tie it to a now-lost mate. One side of the flat circular base is missing.   NOTES:   1. See, for example, R. O.

311074,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This gazelle is suspended from its four legs, which are drawn up over its belly. The rear leg and foreleg on each side are crossed at the hocks and bound with rope. The flat hooves face forward and backward at 90 degrees to the body. The body sags to form a deep, rounded reservoir. The long neck curves forward, with crease marks shown in the skin. Its head is in an unnatural position; its muzzle is between its trussed forelegs. Its body and thighs are stippled to indicate fur. Four grooves on the body’s bulging sides indicate ribs or creases. Its open eyes are large, with heavy, hooded lids; a rosette or curly forelock falls between them. There are heavy tufts of hair at the base of its large ears. Straight, spiraled horns extend back from its head, and a large post rises between and slightly in front of them.   On the belly is a hinged, rectangular plate (2.9 x 1.5 cm) showing male genitalia in relief; the surface is stippled like the rest of the animal's body. The plate, which is complete, partially covers a pour hole, presumably to permit the lamp to be filled while burning. The straight end of the plate forms the inner side of the wick hole, which is large (2.9 x 2.1 cm) and rounded.   The lamp stands on a tripod formed by three bent gazelle legs with the flat, cloven hooves on square plates (2 x 2 cm). The proper left foreleg is modern. The gazelle's tail curves downward from under the nozzle and is attached to the bend of the front tripod leg with a shell-like element to form a suspension loop.   A tube projects from the gazelle’s forehead. It has a finished edge into which a rod was inserted. The inner rod is broken off at the level of the outer tube. By analogy with a group of similar lamps, it is likely that the inner tube was a long handle or suspension device terminating in a bird head (1).   The lamp belongs to a group generally associated with Egypt and dated variously from the second century BCE through the second century CE, although only one example comes from a dated context (2). The gazelle (dorcas) is a small genus of antelope known to Pliny and Aelian as being native to North Africa and was a popular import to Rome (3). Roman mosaics and wall paintings usually show the animal captured in a net, but the Harvard lamp preserves an image that occurs throughout ancient Egyptian art and demonstrates that this artistic motif continued in use into the Roman and Coptic periods (4).   NOTES:   1. See M. Dodt, “Eine bronze Öllampe mit Tierkopf aus Zülpich und ihre möglichen Vorbilder,” Kölner Jahrbuch 33 (2000): 329-40, which describes and illustrates five examples (Bonn, Rheinisches Landesmuseum, inv. no.

He believes they could be either censors or lamps (ibid., 340). In four examples the rod is attached to the back of the animal's neck; the example in the Louvre (ibid., 355, no. 5) has a similar tube within a tube rising from the forehead. Markings on the British Museum example suggest to Dodt that the long rod was removable when the lamp stood on a table or stand (ibid., 338).   2. See D. M.

Badawy 1978 (supra 3) 321-32, gives examples of the inventiveness of theriomorphic forms in Roman Egypt, among which he cites an open lamp with volute nozzles whose rod-hook is supported by dolphins (ibid., figs. 5.6 and 5.12) and a lamp in Turin, also noted by Dodt 2000 (supra 1). He does not date these examples but discusses them in the context of fifth- to sixth-century CE items. However, the Turin lamp lacks the naturalism and careful surface detailing of the Harvard piece.     Jane Ayer Scott",NULL,NULL

He stands on a flat rectangular plate with a cylindrical peg underneath for attachment. The elongated proportions provide a high waist, while angular features mark the face. The reddish-brown patina and light weight of the metal are unusual.    Harpokrates represents the god Horus as a child, shown nude with the side-lock of youth on the right side of his head and his right index finger to his mouth. As the son of Osiris and Isis, he gained immense popularity during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, during which time the production of bronze figurines of Harpokrates flourished. He often wears the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, a feature common in first millennium Egypt when youthful deities acquired kingly attributes. Another characteristic headdress is the nemes head cloth, although frequently the boy is depicted with either a shaven head or a tight-fitting skull cap. His nude body typically retains the roundness of flesh associated with young boys. The child-god could be represented seated, striding, or squatting. When seated, he assumes a semi-reclining position derived from that of a baby on its mother’s lap; many of the smaller examples of these figurines may originally have belonged with a seated Isis figure (1). Suspension loops for attachment as a pendant indicate an amuletic connection that may have been particularly associated with young children.    NOTES:   1. G.

It is cast with an oval, double-stranded ring-handle with a stirrup-like thickening at the top and prominent knobs at the handle base.    It was excavated in a horse burial associated with a human grave at Gammai on the eastern side of the Nile in Nubia, at the Second Cataract (1). Because it was found together with four other similar bells at the horse’s neck and three more under the neck, it clearly served as a horse bell. At the time of excavation, one bell still preserved two fragments of a three-ply leather cord that passed through the suspension ring. Also found associated with the horse skeleton were an iron bit, remains of a pad-saddle, a plain iron ring, and remains of string trappings from the horse’s head (fragments of simple woven fabric with attached braids).    With its characteristic handle shape, the bell belongs to a type common in the Nubian Ballana Culture and found associated with horses and camels, for example at Quostol, c. 30 miles north of Gammai (2). It is one of two bells in the Harvard Art Museums from Gammai (the other is 1924.75.A)   A large variety of shapes of copper alloy bells are known from Nubia and also from Egypt in earlier periods, at least since Dynasty 23; they served as amulets (especially for children) and animal bells, votive offerings, and musical or signal instruments in sacred contexts (3). Rare, elaborately-decorated examples from Meroe depict enemies in fetters (4), while copper alloy bowls from post-Meroitic el-Hobagi have miniature bells attached to the rim (5). The bells appear to have served a variety of purposes, notably in a cultic context and as amulets for humans and animals. Their use as part of horse harnesses—usually of rulers’ horses—appears to be a particular feature of the Nubian post-Meroitic and Ballana Cultures that survived into the medieval period (6).

Areas with damage include the nose, lips, and the right side of the chin. There is some chipping on the ears and eyebrows and some surface pitting. The head was worked for insertion into a statue.   The type of face and arrangement of hair is a conflation of known Tiberius portraits and should be dated in the early 20s, when the Emperor was about sixty to sixty-five years old. The most popular group of portraits of this period, A.D. 22—23, is the Clementia Tiberii group, so named by Luigi Polacco (Il volto di Tiberio, Padua, 1954) from the coins. The Jovian statue of Tiberius in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen (no. 538) found in an exedra with three niches at the shrine of Diana at Nemi, and evidently set up with similar statues of Germanicus (no. 644) and Drusus Jr. (no. 529), shows, how this Harvard head and start of the right shoulder would have looked as part of a heroic, half-draped figure intended for veneration. Vagn Poulsen deduced that the Nemi triad, with an altar in front of the hemicycle with its rectangular niches, was dedicated after the death of Germanicus in A.D. 19 and before the death of the younger Drusus in A.D. 23.

Near the interior curve on both sides, there are a series of lines, followed by a band of interlocking triangles. On one side only in the main field there is a large hatched swastika flanked on either side by a hatched Maltese cross; it is unclear if the less well-preserved field on the other side originally had similar decorations. The interior curve of the razor is elliptical rather than semicircular; the blade is thickest here, with a relatively high ridge, and the blade thins slightly from the interior toward the edge. There is a decorative knob on the inner curve of the razor close to the handle. The razor is intact aside from extensive chipping along the edge of the blade, particularly near the handle. The thin handle is also intact and is decorated with a crescent shape on either side of the suspension ring. The surface patina is dark green with areas of dark brown.   The razor best compares to V. Bianco Peroni’s type “Bennaci varietà B,” although the incised decorations in the field of the blade are best paralleled by an example of type “Vetralla.” Both types have a similar geographical distribution in central Italy, appearing in Bologna, Etruria, Umbria, and Picenum (1).            It is difficult to understand the use and symbolism of the bronze objects from Iron Age Italy that are classified as razors. Possibly used for trimming hair or beards, these razors seem to have had some symbolic value. They are typically found in male burials, and their inclusion in grave goods may indicate that the deceased was a man of mature age; or, in cases where they are found in female burials, they may be indicative of the owner’s elevated social status (2). Some razors have been found with fibulae fastened through the handle, demonstrating that they could be worn (3). Many examples have repaired handles, showing that the razors were important enough to fix if broken (4).   Razors are typically plain or covered with incised decoration, most frequently lines, bands of interlocking triangles, meanders, lines of dots hatched swastikas, and Maltese crosses. The two-edged examples, like 1987.135.28, more often bear incised concentric circles or have decorative perforations on the blade. Often there are decorative spurs, crescents, or volutes on the handles, depending on the type.   NOTES:   1. For type “Bennaci varietà B,” see V. Bianco Peroni, I rasoi nell’Italia continentale, Prähistorische Bronzefunde 7.2 (Munich, 1979) 139-52, nos. 899-934, and pl. 74; for type “Vetralla,” see ibid., 113-15, esp. no. 664 from Fermo.

This impression is reinforced by the placement of her arms: the right is bowed out to the side, as if for balance, while the left is swung forward, its hand missing. Dressed in a long, diaphanous tunic, the figure’s breasts, rendered as two knobs of bronze set high upon her chest, are visible beneath her costume. A pattern of long vertical waves creates the impression sheer fabric. The bottom of her tunic bears a leaf-like motif. The woman’s hair is combed back from her face and tucked into a cap of some type, perhaps a snood, and she wears a crown with a lightly incised pattern, possibly depicting rays. Identified as “female figures of worshippers or perhaps temple attendants,” late Archaic korai figures of this type are sometimes shown holding offerings or making gestures of prayer (1). Richardson places this piece within her group of provincial korai, which “imitate the costumes and gestures of the Ionian or Severe korai of the late Archaic period, but in an exaggerated way” (2).

The piece is exceptionally well-preserved considering its size and date.    This stand was the largest copper alloy object excavated at Nuzi and may have functioned as a censer or as the support of an offering vessel. This conical stand is an interesting precursor to the Late Bronze Age tripod stands used in the Ancient Near East, Cyprus and the Aegean (2).

311337,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The goddess Diana (Artemis) is shown as a huntress. She strides forward onto her right leg, which is missing below the knee. Her left leg, preserved only to the top of her boot, holds her weight and is slightly bent. Her left arm is bent over her chest, and her left hand is pierced to hold her bow, which was made separately and is missing. She reaches back with her right arm to draw an arrow from the quiver on her back. Her bare arms are tubular, with no modeling of the muscles. She wears a short chiton with a cloak held in a roll around her waist. The ends of the cloak are tucked up in pouch-like folds.   Her head is slightly raised, and her eyes are wide open as she prepares to take aim. Her hair is parted in the center, and two locks are twisted into a topknot in front, with rolls of hair fraiming her face and a bun at the back of her head. The statuette is modeled fully in the round. The coiffure, stance, and clothing relate this piece to the cult image of Diana Nemorensis (Diana of the Woods) from the sanctuary of the goddess at Nemi (Ariccia), which dates from the second phase of the sanctuary in the mid-first century BCE. The sanctuary seems to have been active until the mid-second century CE (1). Diana was the goddess of the hunt and protectress of the woods as well as women, especially in childbirth. Images of her are found in sanctuaries and domestic and commercial contexts. It is difficult to date these figures, which were mass-produced over a long period of time. The votive bronze images of Diana found at Nemi are dated from the third to first centuries BCE (2), but the Harvard piece also resembles the image of Diana on a terracotta relief created during the Antonine phase of the courtyard of the Caseggiato di Diana at Ostia that could date from the first to the early second centuries CE (3).

Zeus’s right leg faces diagonally outward; from the stance of his left leg, his left foot must have faced forward, originally parallel with his left arm. The left leg seems bent in such a way that the original stance of the feet seems rather awkward. His torso is massively muscled but summarily modeled. His hair is in a cap-like form with upward-rolled edges; his beard is spade-like with overhanging moustaches. His facial features are summarily rendered. No fingers or toes are depicted on his surviving extremities, except for the projecting thumb of his left hand. A small bird with spread wings, presumably an eagle, sits on the back of his outstretched left hand. His right hand, stretched out behind him, may have held a thunderbolt poised for the throw.    This statuette belongs to a number of striding representations of Zeus that begin in the Late Archaic period, including two examples from Dodona in the National Museum in Athens (1), and the larger bronze striding Zeus, perhaps a Corinthian product, in the Glyptothek in Munich (2). A larger version, really a small statue, from Ugento, is in Taranto (3). Early Classical representations also include a fine example in the Princeton Art Museum and the famous “Blue Zeus” from Dodona in Berlin (4). The entire group is closely related to the monumental bronze statue of a mature god about to hurl a missile at an opponent, recovered from the sea off Cape Artemesion, now in the National Museum in Athens (5).    This Zeus clearly comes from a mainland workshop active c. 460 to 450 BCE. Athens, Corinth, or Argos could equally well be places of origin. While the roundness of the breaks and the overall weakness of surface details raise some suspicions that the piece might be an aftercast, the general modeling of the stance and the presence of trustworthy corrosion products support the authenticity of this piece.

The cursory execution and small size still reveal the basic features of the type. Crudely detailed facial features with semicircular ears, almond-shaped eyes, and a slash for a mouth, could indicate a closer affinity with the Hittite sphere than with that of Egypt or the Southern Levant; however, it lacks the strongly Hittitizing elements seen in 1992.256.77. Possible relations can be traced in several of the copper alloy figurines found at the Syrian coastal site of Ras Shamra (ancient Ugarit) dating to the Late Bronze Age (1).    The geographical area of the Levant, comprising the regions of present-day Israel, Lebanon, western Syria, and south-central Turkey, produced an extraordinary number of small copper alloy figurines from the end of the third millennium into the beginning of the first millennium BCE (2). Most of these figurines depict a standing male figure with left foot advancing and right arm raised in a position of smiting (3). Often the hands are pierced with holes to hold weapons or armor. These separate elements are preserved in a few examples, the most spectacular being a warrior holding a spear and shield found in a late thirteenth or early twelfth century BCE building at Enkomi on Cyprus (4). The figurines have a wide distribution, with examples found as far away as Greece, but the majority is concentrated along the Mediterranean coast of the Levant (5).   While the figurines share a common conceptual underpinning, the actual forms and styles of the small copper alloys display a remarkable range of diversity. In general, they appear to move along a spectrum from those that include a high degree of Egyptianizing elements, presumably produced in regions closer to Egypt, to those showing stronger affinities with the Hittite artistic tradition of central Turkey. Such stylistic features are evident in the shape and type of the tall crown, the form of the short skirt or kilt, and the proportions of the body. The basic iconography of the smiting figure is derived from the Egyptian image of Pharaoh defeating his enemies; yet, there is no exact parallel in Egypt, indicating a peculiarly Levantine iconographic conception. The figure most likely represents a deity, sometimes identified as either Baal or Reshep, two West Semitic gods. Although no definitive evidence exists to support these attributions, some examples have horns on their headdresses, which are a Near Eastern attribute of divinity (6). Where archaeological contexts are sufficiently well preserved, the figurines are clearly associated with cultic spaces. The largest group of excavated figurines comes from several locations in the temple complex at Byblos on the Lebanese coast, while another set was excavated in a Late Bronze Age temple complex at Kamid el-Loz in inland Lebanon (7). The precise dating of the figurines remains fraught for several reasons. First, many were hoarded and only buried well after their date of manufacture. Second, there is only poor information available, if there is any at all, on the provenience of a large portion of the figurines in museum collections. Finally, while the overall conception of the figurines unites them as a group, the diversity of individual features and styles often makes stylistic comparisons difficult.    NOTES:    1. H.

The squat proportions, broad shoulders tapering to a narrow waist, the short and tightly fitting kilt, and the emphasized musculature further indicate strong Hittite influences. However, the smiting posture, here seen in the standard arrangement of the proper right arm raised and the left extended out to the front, is less typical for Hittite gods and more closely associated with the regions of the northern Levant that fell within the Hittite sphere of political influence at the end of the second millennium BCE (2). The figure wears a tall conical crown and has a well-modeled body and clearly defined facial features, including modeled eyes, ears, and mouth.

Although no definitive evidence exists to support these attributions, some examples have horns on their headdresses, which are a Near Eastern attribute of divinity (7). Where archaeological contexts are sufficiently well preserved, the figurines are clearly associated with cultic spaces. The largest group of excavated figurines comes from several locations in the temple complex at Byblos on the Lebanese coast, while another set was excavated in a Late Bronze Age temple complex at Kamid el-Loz in inland Lebanon (8). The precise dating of the figurines remains fraught for several reasons. First, many were hoarded and only buried well after their date of manufacture. Second, there is only poor information available, if there is any at all, on the provenience of a large portion of the figurines in museum collections. Finally, while the overall conception of the figurines unites them as a group, the diversity of individual features and styles often makes stylistic comparisons difficult.    NOTES:   1.

311828,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Based on its slender proportions and the White Crown of Egypt that it wears, this smiting figurine belongs to the highly Egyptianizing group of copper alloy figurines associated with the coasts of Lebanon and Syria. The delicate features of the face and arms provide serenity to what is most likely a divine image. The excised eyes may have originally been inlaid, and the pierced raised right hand originally held a weapon that was fashioned separately. The left hand, extended out in front with palm open, may have supported a shield. The well-rounded modeling of the body transitions smoothly at the waist from the frontal upper torso to the sideways orientation of the legs. Short tangs below each foot served for attachment to a base. Comparable examples have been excavated in Late Bronze Age levels at Megiddo in Israel, Byblos and Kamid el-Loz in Lebanon, and Ras Shamra (ancient Ugarit) and Minet el-Beida (the port city of Ugarit) in Syria (1). On several of these figurines, gold leaf was added over the face, crown, or body.   The geographical area of the Levant, comprising the regions of present-day Israel, Lebanon, western Syria, and south-central Turkey, produced an extraordinary number of small copper alloy figurines from the end of the third millennium into the beginning of the first millennium BCE (2). Most of these figurines depict a standing male figure with left foot advancing and right arm raised in a position of smiting (3). Often the hands are pierced with holes to hold weapons or armor. These separate elements are preserved in a few examples, the most spectacular being a warrior holding a spear and shield found in a late thirteenth or early twelfth century BCE building at Enkomi on Cyprus (4). The figurines have a wide distribution, with examples found as far away as Greece, but the majority is concentrated along the Mediterranean coast of the Levant (5).   While the figurines share a common conceptual underpinning, the actual forms and styles of the small copper alloys display a remarkable range of diversity. In general, they appear to move along a spectrum from those that include a high degree of Egyptianizing elements, presumably produced in regions closer to Egypt, to those showing stronger affinities with the Hittite artistic tradition of central Turkey. Such stylistic features are evident in the shape and type of the tall crown, the form of the short skirt or kilt, and the proportions of the body. The basic iconography of the smiting figure is derived from the Egyptian image of Pharaoh defeating his enemies; yet, there is no exact parallel in Egypt, indicating a peculiarly Levantine iconographic conception. The figure most likely represents a deity, sometimes identified as either Baal or Reshep, two West Semitic gods.

There are oval-shaped hammer marks around the springs. The pin is broken 6 cm from the tip and has been reattached with soil and adhesive. The surface has green corrosion and thick burial accretions overall.    The serpentine fibula has an elegant form that consists of a single length of wire formed into a crescent-shaped fastener for clothing. One end of the wire has been sharpened into a point to puncture the cloth, while the opposite end has been shaped into a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin. Two single springs incorporated into the wire apply tension between the catchplate and pin. The section between the springs, called the bow, curves in harmony with the arch of the pin. There are nineteen serpentine fibulae in the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, and these fibulae have minor stylistic variations in form and decoration. They have no known provenience; however, serpentine fibulae were common during the Iron Age, and they are found distributed throughout Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and France (1).    The serpentine type of fibula is considered to have descended from the Late Bronze Age violin-bow type, which has a straight pin and a single spring. Replacing the violin-bow, the serpentine fibulae came into general use during the Early Iron Age, and the type continued to be used throughout the next half century. During this time, communities created their own types of fibulae, and discrete variations in the form developed. Trade in Italy during the eighth century BCE contributed to the spread of provincial styles; as a result, the traceability of their origins has been complicated. Serpentine fibulae were common in Sicily during Greek colonization, hence the type has also been termed “Sicilian” (2). Changes in the form have been used to date serpentine fibulae, the earliest of which have a flattened spiral catchplate. As the Iron Age progressed, the catchplate developed into a simple, folded channel, which became longer over time (3). 1987.135.53 and 1987.135.40 have the longest catchplates in the collection and probably date to the Late Iron Age, while the remaining fibulae with shorter catchplates are most likely from the Early Iron Age. Some of the fibulae in the Harvard collection have incised decorations, including 1987.135.38, which bears a herringbone pattern partially obscured by corrosion (4).

311851,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Known as Mercury to the Romans, the statuette depicts a version of the Greek god Hermes Agoraios (“Hermes of the marketplace”), a patron of commerce who brings wealth and good luck. In the extended right hand, the figure holds a moneybag, a marsuppium, suggesting that the image could provide prosperity to its ancient owner. Cradled upright in the left arm is a herald’s staff, a caduceus, which, along with a winged traveler’s hat, identifies Mercury in his role as messenger of the gods. The god is nude except for a cloak draped from the shoulders and across the chest, called a chlamys. The missing lower legs would have attached the free-standing figure to a pedestal or cylindrical base.   In the Roman household, statuettes such as this one were sometimes grouped with other figures of deities in a shrine, called a lararium (1). This form of statuette was produced and reproduced in large numbers, which testifies to the importance of Mercury as purveyor of good fortune, monetary or otherwise. It was so popular that Mercury figures are found throughout the Roman Empire in a wide range of styles from naturalistic, classical figures to more provincial types, such as this example (2).    Although produced during the Roman Imperial period, the statuette is inspired by a major sculptural type originally created around 440 BCE by the Greek artist Polykleitos. It is a small-scale example of the innovative Polykleitan style, which established an approach to the representation of the human figure by incorporating scientific theories of proportion and symmetry. This was demonstrated by the sculptor in his famous treatise on the topic, called the Kanon, and exemplified by his most notable sculpture, the Doryphoros or “Spearbearer” (3).    NOTES:   1.

Although it lacks the characteristic beard of the goat family, it bears the backswept horns of the wild ibex. The legs are held close together, the hind ones slightly bent and the rump raised to create an arching back that conveys the agility and grace of these mountain leapers. Rounded modeling produces a full belly, further supplementing the fluid lines. Each haunch and shoulder displays an excised dot within an incised circle, with a similar marking for the eyes. The tail is broken; the ill-defined horns form a V-shape as they rise up from the front of the head. The muzzle sports a blunted nose, and the chest overhangs the front legs to form a small “shelf.” The rectangular base is hollow. The back rises up slightly at its juncture with the neck and is pierced. From this, a bronze wire links the animal to an amulet in the form of an open hand.    A number of such bronze ibexes (identified by the excavator as gazelles) were recovered from the late antique site of Dura-Europos on the Euphrates River in Syria (1). Two specimens, each found in women’s burials in the necropolis, display twisted wire links dangling from the holes in the base (2), from which bells were suspended. The bronzes are difficult to date more precisely than the period of the city’s greatest prosperity: the first century BCE through the second century CE. A closely comparable bronze was found much farther afield at the provincial Roman capital of Augusta Raurica (present-day Augst, situated near Basel, Switzerland), also dating from the end of the first century BCE through the second century CE (3). The hand may or may not have been originally intended to accompany the animal None of the Dura-Europos examples nor the Augusta Raurica piece have attached hand amulets, although they are equipped with suspension loops on their backs that occasionally preserve ancient chain links. Nonetheless, unpierced faience hand amulets do occur in a few Dura-Europos burials, including one instance from the same tomb as a bronze ibex (4). Small amulets in the form of a hand, sometimes clenched in a fist (mano fica) or with particular finger arrangements (for example, the “hand of Sabazios”), were popular during this time in a range of cultures and regions and are therefore difficult to interpret (5). Those with an open hand have been associated with the gesture of benediction.   NOTES:    1. N. P.

The Augst example (now in the Antiken Museum Basel, inv. no. 07.1262) exhibits the same upright posture with bent hind legs and arrangement of the ear and horns; it also has pierced holes through the back and the triangularly sloping base. The Augst bronze is 3.9 cm high, roughly the same size as the Harvard piece. It has a protrusion from the rear quarters, probably the tail as seen in the Dura-Europos pieces, and its rougher surface shows no evidence of circular markings. See A.

The base has four globular feet and an incised design on one side. The type is characteristic of Anatolia where it seems to have been particularly popular, to judge from the numbers found there. It belongs to a grouping of small-scale eagles from that region that are represented alone or on the top of bases resembling altars (1). Most are probably ex votos dedicated in rural sanctuaries, but some examples with suspension loops may be apotropaic, serving as pendants or amulets. Eagle figurines are known from all parts of the Roman Empire, where they came to represent the victorious Roman state. They are also connected to the cult of Jupiter, the chief divinity of Imperial Rome; the eagle symbolized the emperor as embodied in that god. Set on a pyramid or altar, this example suggests that it was intended as a dedication in a public sanctuary, or perhaps for display in a domestic cult setting such as a lararium (2).   NOTES:   1.

The handle consists of a large ring, which is attached to the back of the plate that bears the stamp. The stamp itself presents a hedera, or design of ivy, as a decorative way of filling in the extra space at the end of the first line. Serifs are found on most of the letters. The letters of the stamp are in high relief.    The stamp reads: COSSINI EVTYCHIANI   “Of Cossinus Eutychianus” (1).   Each of the six Roman bronze stamps in the Harvard Art Museums consists of a plate, on which the die of the stamp is carved, and a ring, attached to the back of the plate, which serves as a handle for applying the stamp (2). With the exception of 1977.216.3250, Harvard’s stamps are approximately the same size (c. 5-6 cm long and 2-3 cm wide), and all are inscribed with text. Stamps were produced in a variety of shapes. Most are rectangular, but they could also be elliptical, circular, rhomboid, or in the shape of a tabella ansata, a foot, or, less commonly, a hand. Five of the six stamps in the Harvard Art Museums are rectangular. Four of these have two lines of writing inscribed on them; one other rectangular stamp contains a single line of text, which is limited to initials. The sixth stamp, 1977.216.1963, takes the shape of a foot and also has only one line of writing. This stamp appears to contain pseudo-alphabetic characters. Four others are inscribed in Latin, with the lettering raised and written backwards, a mirror image of the text the stamp would produce. 1977.216.3250 is inscribed in Greek letters but not written retrograde, meaning that the stamp’s impression would have been backwards.   Many types of objects in the ancient world bore stamped impressions, including amphorae, roof tiles, bricks, lamps, glass vessels, and terra sigillata (fine pottery). Textiles and bread were also sometimes stamped, and stamps like Harvard’s may have been used for such a purpose (3). Roof tiles and bricks were being stamped in Greece as early as the Archaic period. In the West, the earliest evidence for stamps comes from amphorae dated from the end of the fourth to the beginning of the third centuries BCE (4).   The texts of stamps most often refer to the name of the producer or manufacturer of the product in the genitive case (e.g., 1978.495.34 “of Cossinus Eutychianus”). In certain instances, the name is written using ligatures or abbreviations. Other stamps include an image such as a leaf (hedera) or an abstract pattern, while some stamps have writing in what seems to be an imitation of alphabetic characters, although it is clearly not Latin or Greek (5). In these cases, where the recipients of such goods were most likely illiterate, the presence of a stamp on the object may have sufficed to guarantee a certain level of quality. Stamps could have varying degrees of decoration along the border and may or may not have a horizontal element to divide separate lines of text (6). The extent a stamp was used varied according to workshop; certain workshops continued to use their stamps until the writing was no longer legible before replacing them (7).   NOTES:   1.

The surfaces have been treated like most marbles surviving from the Renaissance, namely, the end of the hair at the back and the left shoulder were restored in Carrara marble. The remainder of the bust, the subject's right shoulder and lower left breast ""are also made of Parian marble, although unrelated to the head, and may possibly have been taken from another classical statue (i.e., another bust).""   Antonia was the daughter of Mark Antony, niece of Augustus, wife of Nero Drusus and mother of Claudius and Germanicus (born 36 B.C., died A.D. 39).  This portrait of the courtesy ""Empress (Augusta)"" in her later years parallels the numismatic likenesses struck in her memory by her grandson Caligula and her son Claudius (third and fourth emperors).  The somewhat ideal presentation of a noble lady is based on a prototype probably created late in the reign of Augustus and known in other versions.  Like Queen Elizabeth II on coins, she was not portrayed as aging as rapidly in art as in reality.  As Erika Simon has observed in connection with a pair of marble busts of great sensitivity, Antonia and Augustus, such portraits were made late in the reign of Tiberius and until A.D. 39 under Caligula because Antonia Minor succeeded Livia as priestess of Divus Augustus in A.D. 29 (Simon, 1982, pp. 236-243, under nos. 166-167).   This replica of the mature likeness of the aristocratic matron Antonia is sometimes confused in the post-Renaissance and modern literature with the bust from the collection of the Hon. Robert Erskine.  In the latter instance, however, the bust is entirely restored or, at least, alien (Sotheby Sale, London, 10 July, 1979, pp. 134-135, no. 284).

312124,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This tall, thin cat wears the amuletic wadjet eye of Horus on its chest. The pectoral hangs from a faintly incised thin chain with a counterpoise on the back (1). Incised lines also mark the ear hair and whiskers. Holes in both ears would have held earrings and the eyes are excised for inlays. The body is hollow with a circular opening below the hindquarters and the remains of a tenon below the legs. A large gash in the metal forms a ragged crescent shape along the left haunch.    The seated cat was the most popular animal depicted in bronze during the first millennium BCE and accompanied the increasingly widespread recognition of sacred animal cults from the Late Period through the Ptolemaic (664-30 BCE) (2). The house cat, as the domesticated counterpart to the wild feline, especially the lion, appears in Egyptian art at least as early as the Middle Kingdom (c. 2134-1665 BCE). The male, or tomcat, was associated with the sun god, and in the New Kingdom (c. 1571-1076 BCE) played an important role in the Book of the Dead as the slayer of the Apophis serpent, enemy of the sun god. In all likelihood, however, the bronze statuettes represent the female cat and are connected with a series of goddesses, in particular Bastet.   Bastet was an ancient goddess, known from at least the beginning of the Old Kingdom (c. 2687-2191 BCE). She and several other goddesses associated with the solar element were represented as feline-headed. Over time, she acquired the more benevolent characteristics of the domesticated cat, known for its fertility and nocturnal sex life, in opposition to the more threatening leonine aspects assumed by the goddess Sekhmet. In this role, Bastet and, by extension, cats were seen to be peaceful and protective. While there were other goddesses who manifested themselves as cats, for example Pakhet (“She Who Scratches”) in Middle Egypt, Bastet’s supremacy rose during the first millennium, probably as a direct result of her connection to the rulers of Dynasty 22 (c. 931-725 BCE) who came from Bubastis, the ancient cult center of Bastet.    Bubastis (modern Tell Basta near Zagazig in the eastern Delta), in addition to other Egyptian sites, became the site of a large cat cemetery at the temple of Bastet, in which mummified cats were deposited as votives. Skeletal evidence suggests that the mummified cats had been intentionally killed while still young, rather than having been cherished pets that died of natural causes (3). Small cat figurines were often wrapped in the linen bandages of the mummified remains, which were in turn placed in bronze or wooden containers in the shape of seated cats. Many of the larger, hollow-cast bronze cats can be interpreted in this way and retain an opening into the body cavity. The majority of the bronzes, however, were dedicated in shrines.   The dedication of cat mummies and votive statues has been connected to a highly institutionalized cult of the king, which may explain the large number and standardized iconography of the bronzes (4). Although there is a wide variety of types preserved, most of the bronzes achieve an anatomical correctness and express the essence of cats—haughty dignity and aloofness. They assume the seated position with head held erect and tail curled along the right side as in the hieroglyphic sign. One or both of the ears tend to be pierced, and gold hoop earrings remain on some examples. The frequent presence of a scarab beetle placed on the forehead and a pectoral on the chest suggests the protective function and solar connection of such figures.   NOTES:   1.

There are large cuts across the back of the hair and neck. The stone is incrusted with whitish material. The surface is dull.  This head appears to be a forgery after a type of the fifth century B.C., such as the Roman Imperial statue of a mourning captive (province?), known as the ""Medea"" and in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence.  The head is turned to the right and is slightly lowered, with its gaze falling downward to the subject's left. The locks of hair are long and fall onto the shoulders, and the casually waved tresses come down low on the forehead, on either side of the central part. The lady wears a broad fillet across the top of the head. It disappears under the hair at the side.   Richard Norton saw the head not long before he wrote to Edward Forbes on May 29, 1899, ""outside Rome in a vineyard....It must have been in some Villa or Forum--that's why I call it 'decorative...'. It represents, I take it, some conquered province and is not unlike the famous Ludovisi 'Medusa.'""   Over the years various persons who have studied the head have adduced parallels, ancient and modern. One of the latter is the restored head and upper shoulders, in high relief, of the male captive, of Celtic or Germanic origin, standing against a trophy and with a boar-topped standard at his right side in an architectural panel now placed, as no. 605, on the landing outside the entrance to the Galleria dei Candelabri of the Vatican. According to Edward W. Forbes, in notes on a European trip in 1905, Adolf Furtwangler said the head conflated aspects of the Lemnian Athena (as represented by the head in Bologna) and the Antinous Mondragone in the Louvre. Professor Furtwängler had viewed the head with Mr. Forbes on 4 October, 1904, and he studied it again with Matthew S. Prichard of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, on the following day. Professor Furtwängler summed up his feelings in a note written to Mr. Forbes after his departure from Boston: ""Though it is always a beautiful thing, nourished with the beauty of Phidias' Lemnian Athena; and the difference is only, that the artist, who made this extract, did not live so far off from us.""

The feet rest on a small plate, the back edge of which has been filed in recent times; there is no indication of any attachment pegs. The execution of the chubby body is concealed by the heavy accretions. There is a modern hole for attachment in the rear.    Harpokrates represents the god Horus as a child, shown nude with the side-lock of youth on the right side of his head and his right index finger to his mouth. As the son of Osiris and Isis, he gained immense popularity during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, during which time the production of bronze figurines of Harpokrates flourished. He often wears the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, a feature common in first millennium Egypt when youthful deities acquired kingly attributes. Another characteristic headdress is the nemes head cloth, although frequently the boy is depicted with either a shaven head or a tight-fitting skull cap. His nude body typically retains the roundness of flesh associated with young boys. The child-god could be represented seated, striding, or squatting. When seated, he assumes a semi-reclining position derived from that of a baby on its mother’s lap; many of the smaller examples of these figurines may originally have belonged with a seated Isis figure (1).

There are rectangular hammer marks around the spring adjacent to the catchplate. The catchplate has a minor loss on the inside corner. There are several bends and distortions in the wire pin. The surface has green corrosion and thick burial accretions overall.    The serpentine fibula has an elegant form that consists of a single length of wire formed into a crescent-shaped fastener for clothing. One end of the wire has been sharpened into a point to puncture the cloth, while the opposite end has been shaped into a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin. Two single springs incorporated into the wire apply tension between the catchplate and pin. The section between the springs, called the bow, curves in harmony with the arch of the pin. There are nineteen serpentine fibulae in the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, and these fibulae have minor stylistic variations in form and decoration. They have no known provenience; however, serpentine fibulae were common during the Iron Age, and they are found distributed throughout Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and France (1).    The serpentine type of fibula is considered to have descended from the Late Bronze Age violin-bow type, which has a straight pin and a single spring. Replacing the violin-bow, the serpentine fibulae came into general use during the Early Iron Age, and the type continued to be used throughout the next half century. During this time, communities created their own types of fibulae, and discrete variations in the form developed. Trade in Italy during the eighth century BCE contributed to the spread of provincial styles; as a result, the traceability of their origins has been complicated. Serpentine fibulae were common in Sicily during Greek colonization, hence the type has also been termed “Sicilian” (2). Changes in the form have been used to date serpentine fibulae, the earliest of which have a flattened spiral catchplate. As the Iron Age progressed, the catchplate developed into a simple, folded channel, which became longer over time (3). 1987.135.53 and 1987.135.40 have the longest catchplates in the collection and probably date to the Late Iron Age, while the remaining fibulae with shorter catchplates are most likely from the Early Iron Age.

The springs have a fine dimple mark that may be from hammering. The surface has green corrosion and thick burial accretions overall.    The serpentine fibula has an elegant form that consists of a single length of wire formed into a crescent-shaped fastener for clothing. One end of the wire has been sharpened into a point to puncture the cloth, while the opposite end has been shaped into a catchplate to hold the tip of the pin. Two single springs incorporated into the wire apply tension between the catchplate and pin. The section between the springs, called the bow, curves in harmony with the arch of the pin. There are nineteen serpentine fibulae in the Harvard Art Museums’ collection, and these fibulae have minor stylistic variations in form and decoration. They have no known provenience; however, serpentine fibulae were common during the Iron Age, and they are found distributed throughout Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and France (1).    The serpentine type of fibula is considered to have descended from the Late Bronze Age violin-bow type, which has a straight pin and a single spring. Replacing the violin-bow, the serpentine fibulae came into general use during the Early Iron Age, and the type continued to be used throughout the next half century. During this time, communities created their own types of fibulae, and discrete variations in the form developed. Trade in Italy during the eighth century BCE contributed to the spread of provincial styles; as a result, the traceability of their origins has been complicated. Serpentine fibulae were common in Sicily during Greek colonization, hence the type has also been termed “Sicilian” (2). Changes in the form have been used to date serpentine fibulae, the earliest of which have a flattened spiral catchplate. As the Iron Age progressed, the catchplate developed into a simple, folded channel, which became longer over time (3). 1987.135.53 and 1987.135.40 have the longest catchplates in the collection and probably date to the Late Iron Age, while the remaining fibulae with shorter catchplates are most likely from the Early Iron Age. Some of the fibulae in the Harvard collection have incised decorations, including 1987.135.38, which bears a herringbone pattern partially obscured by corrosion (4). Inscribed, consecutive parallel line patterns, similar to the ones on 1987.135.51, have been found on serpentine fibulae in central Italy (5).    NOTES:   1. Compare serpentine fibulae in J.

312241,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This fragmentary Sardinian warrior, possibly an archer, is missing much of the bow or spear held over his shoulder, the arms from just above the elbows down, and the lower body from the waist down. The head is long and oval, with simple details typical of other Sardinian warriors. The globular, curving ears are positioned far back on the head. The brows are prominent; the eyes are large oblong knobs; the nose is a thin, prominent triangle. The mouth is a simple line above a small, pointed chin. He wears a helmet with a central ridge and long thin, curving horns—the right horn is missing approximately half, while the left has broken off entirely. There is a quasi-chevron pattern on the back of his head representing hair, which is interrupted by a long inverted V-shape that continues into the eight neck rings covering his disproportionately long neck (1).   Over his right shoulder he bears a transverse rod with a faint spiral texture (2). Figures of Sardinian warriors carrying a weapon at an angle over the shoulder are well known, but the weapon is usually over the left shoulder rather than the right (3); the weapon is most often a bow, although spears are also seen. On his torso, the archer wears a V-neck garment with short sleeves; it covers him down to and perhaps below the level of the square pouch visible on his front. The straps of the garment may be connected to the prominent shape on his back, perhaps representing a quiver. This figure would probably have been a votive dedication at a temple or other sacred area (4). This object was sampled for alloy testing in the 1970s (5).   NOTES:   1.

Although surface corrosion has obscured some of the details of the muzzle and eyes, the piece’s hood-like mane and ruff retain a faint quasi-geometrical pattern meant to indicate fur. Three raised slashes on the body denote the ribcage. This piece does not resemble the more familiar type of Etruscan lion, which is depicted with a highly articulated mane (with the fur picked out in a tongue or geometrical pattern) and its head raised in an active or rampant stance (1). The figure is flattened on the bottom, most likely to allow it to decorate a flat surface, such as the rim of a large vase. Between the front paws and in the loop of the tail there appears to be the remains of iron pins, which would have been used to secure the piece to a vessel. An Archaic Greek reclining lion, formerly in the Mildenberg collection and dated c. 550 BCE, has a similar placement of rivet holes along with the remains of ancient rivets; it is also thought to have had a similar purpose to Harvard’s piece (2). As A. Kozloff notes, “Reclining lions such as this, sold cast with a flat bottom and heads turned to one side, regularly stood guard over the rims of vessels or along the edges of pieces of furniture in Archaic Greece” (3).   Exact parallels for 1955.120 and 1952.18 have been difficult to find, making it challenging place the pieces chronologically.   NOTES:   1. See A.

312252,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"In 187 CE, Julia Domna, the daughter of the priest of the sun god at Emesa in Syria, married emperor Septimius Severus (193-211 CE), who was only a general at the time. Their sons, the later emperors Caracalla and Geta, were born in 188 and 189 CE, respectively.    The fleshy face, strong nose and chin, and long, thick neck are characteristic features of the empress. She appears to be wearing a wig, parted in the center and descending in sausage-like waves on either side of her face. Wisps of her own hair escape onto her cheeks (1).   The head, as cast, consisted only of a face framed by curls; the back of the head had been covered by a large, separately cast bun. Small, rectangular chaplet holes at the correct locations for ear lobes were never patched and were probably used to attach earrings. Another unpatched chaplet hole in the left side of the neck might have been hidden by a veil. The eyes are solid cast, with a ring marking the iris and a shallow semicircular depression marking the pupil. The details of the eyes and the incised strands of hair were cut in the wax working model. The head was gilded, and minute traces of leaf gilding can be seen among the corrosion products on the back of the neck. The left side of the face is collapsed from the cheekbone upward, including the eye and the hair, and the long nose is bent toward the right side of the face. There is also a break above the mouth. These damages predate the formation of the corrosion products and suggest that the statue of Julia Domna was deliberately destroyed. The hair is broken at the back of the head, leaving only a short section of finished edge on the right side. The back of the neck is also broken, but the original curving edge of the casting is preserved in front. The curving lower edge of the bronze is original, and a gray area following the line of the lower edge represents the lead that was used to attach the neck to the inside of a separately cast torso. Thus, it appears that the head was inserted into the neckline of a garment belonging to a draped statue.   Stolen by a student in 1956, the head of Julia Domna was soon found in the student’s dormitory room on the campus of Harvard University (2).    NOTES:   1.

312253,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A small rounded, curving beak and the conventional markings define the face of this falcon. Simplified feathers are indicated through incised grooves that show traces of dark metal inlay. A broad collar made up of three bands of geometric ornamentation graces the neck. The body of the bird is almost entirely covered with feather-shaped patterns. More geometrical patterns decorate the chest and underside of the tail. The figurine stands on a trapezoidal base with a round peg in its center bottom for attachment. A break at the tip of the tail feathers and a semi-ovoid hole underneath reveal the hollow-casting procedure as well as a now-empty receptacle. Part of the proper right side of the head, including the eye, is broken, which suggests the former presence of a headdress, such as a sun disc. A deep dent mars the back of the neck.   The soaring flight and predatory character of the falcon linked the mighty raptor to the god of the living king, Horus, early in the pharaonic tradition. The living king of Egypt was identified as an earthly Horus, and from the late Predynastic Period (c. 3100 BCE), the king bore a special royal “Horus name.” The falcon, as the sacred animal of Horus, came to symbolize divine kingship, as the king was the earthly representation of Horus. The common appearance of the Double Crown and uraeus on bronze figurines of falcons reinforces this royal connection. The falcon was also associated with the sky, with its eyes representing the sun and the moon and its large wings outspread to protect the earth below. Later, the falcon became associated with the sun god Re, bearing a sun disc on its head (known as Re-Harakhty). Other gods also had falcons as their sacred animals, such as Montu the god of war, who is distinguished by a double-plume headdress.   As with so many animals associated with the divine realm, during the later periods the falcon became the focus of mummification, burial, and votive offerings. The numerous bronze falcon statuettes are characterized by their upright, yet resting, stance with wings folded at the side. They range in size from small ornaments to large, freestanding figures. Many of the larger examples, such as 1943.1118, were hollow-cast with an inner compartment in which an actual bird could be deposited. Hundreds of thousands of mummified falcons were buried in extensive catacombs at sacred sites throughout Egypt. The Greco-Roman period temples at Philae and Edfu represent the final flourishing of the cult. The more elaborately decorated figures include engraved and inlaid detailing of the feathers and facial markings. The facial patterning, seen on 1943.1118, 1957.165, and 1957.166, follows the conventions established early on with the feathered eye and moustachial stripe. Although the representation of falcons remained constant throughout Egyptian history, it is not zoologically accurate and cannot be identified with any particular species (1).   NOTES:   1.

312303,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The small relief depicts a young attendant (victimarius) leading a ram to sacrifice. The man and ram walk to the right. The man’s head is turned in profile and very sketchily modeled; his torso is shown frontally to three-quarter view. He is nude from the waist up. He grasps the ram’s head with his left arm and rests his right arm on its rump. Only the torso of the man is rendered; he does not have a lower body or hands, which would have been hidden behind the ram. The ram, on the other hand, is completely in profile. It walks to the right on an irregular ground line; all four legs of the ram are visible. The ram has a very shaggy coat and tail, represented with clumps rendered at different heights. Like the man, the downward-tilted head is sketchily rendered, but the curving horn, eyes, and snout are discernible. A thin, pointed tang (9 mm long) protrudes from the ground line under the left hind hoof of the ram.   This piece is either a copy of or from the same mold as a relief currently in the Museo Nazionale Archeologico, Naples, which was first published in 1843 and dated to the Neronian-Flavian periods (1). It may have decorated the breastplate or balteus of a horse, as one component of a sacrificial scene, likely a suovetaurilia, or sacrifice of a pig, sheep, and bull (2).

The Macedonian ruler is portrayed standing in heroic nudity with his right hand on his hip and his left arm raised. He would have originally held a spear or lance in his left hand. The legs beneath the knees are restored but the pose is clear; he stands with his weight on his right leg, while his left leg trails behind him (1). The figure is boldly modeled with an expansively muscular chest and dynamic hair. His head is turned slightly to the left as he looks out into the distance (2).    Alexander the Great was the focus of a divine cult in his lifetime, and after his death in 323 BCE, he continued to be worshipped in Greek cities, frequently in association with his successors, the Hellenistic kings who divided and ruled the vast kingdom he had created. The cult of Alexander continued in Roman times, particularly in Macedonia, his homeland, and in Asia Minor, where cities traced their foundations to Alexander’s rule. Small-scale statuettes like this one could have served as votive objects of religious devotion or could have been created out of historical interest (3). Interest in the great military leader was revived under various Roman emperors, including Hadrian (r. 117-138 CE) and Caracalla (r. 211-217 CE) (4).    NOTES:   1. For a photograph before the legs were restored, see L. Pollak, Klassich-antike Goldschmiedearbeiten im Besitze Sr. Excellenz A. J. von Nelidow (Leipzig, 1903) 3.   2. A.

C. C. Vermeule, in The Search for Alexander: An Exhibition (New York, 1980) 118, suggests that “a Macedonian soldier in the service of Severus Alexander (222-235 CE) could have placed this statuette in his household shrine.”   4.

320164,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This fifth- to seventh-century steelyard weight in the shape of an empress represents the most common type of weight used with early Byzantine steelyard scales (1). Earlier scholarship proposed that each weight represented a specific Byzantine empress, but that theory has been overturned in favor of an interpretation of the crowned women as a generic imperial type, perhaps linked to the symbolism of official personifications. The crude outline of the bulky crown is similar to headgear worn by early Byzantine empresses depicted on consular diptychs and marble statuary. She wears a tunic covered by a heavy cloak with deeply grooved folds. Her right hand rests on the edge of the cloak, while her left hand clutches an object variously identified as a scroll or a mappa.   As is typical of weights from this time, the bronze is crudely modeled with no modeling on the reverse. This figure was hollow cast with its surface roughly modeled in wax, and then its interior was filled with lead. An iron pin is visible in the base.    The steelyard still has two copper alloy chains terminating in large hooks. These hooks extend from a loop with a swiveling mechanism that slides over the steelyard’s crossbeam. The crossbeam has three incised scales and three suspension points (two of which still have hooks). The three sides would have corresponded to three distinct ranges of measurement. The scale corresponding to the innermost suspension point is subdivided into 12 sections, each between 1.8 and 2 cm long and inscribed with three dots. The middle scale is more or less regularly subdivided into 25 sections, each between 0.7 cm and 1 cm long. Most of these sections (or sometimes a larger, double section) are inscribed with three dots. The border between the eleventh and twelfth section is marked by the letter K; the border between the twenty-first and twenty-second by V or Λ (Greek upsilon or lambda). The letters represented Greek numerals. The scale corresponding to the outermost suspension point consists of irregular incisions at the border (c. 0.3 cm distance from each other), with the following Greek letters inscribed with punched dots: Λ E M E N E Χ E O E P̣ E (the epsilons are inscribed in reverse; the reading of the penultimate letter is uncertain). The punched dot style of inscription is used on weight crossbeams even in the Roman period (2). It is unusual to have a weight preserved with its crossbeam, if in fact this group belonged together in antiquity; the crossbeam’s markings are exceptionally well preserved.   Steelyards were commonly used throughout the ancient Mediterranean. These crossbeams would have a weight, usually in the form of a person or deity, that slid along the bar of the scale to measure bulk goods (3). Not surprisingly, many of the Late Roman and Byzantine examples with known findspots have been found along a coast or in shipwrecks, reflecting their commercial utility. The standard term in English, “steelyard,” is a bit misleading, deriving from the use of similar scales in the area on the north bank of the Thames, London, where steel merchants clustered until 1597. In the Roman period, a wide range of figures was represented on the weights, reflecting the diversity of forms of Roman small bronzes in general. By the fourth to fifth century CE, this multiplicity had narrowed and almost all steelyards used weights represented a generic empress type (like this example) or the goddess Athena (Minerva) (4). Although many late examples have been dated generally to the Late Roman period, the most firmly dated example is from the seventh-century shipwreck of Yassi Ada, off the coast of modern Turkey (5). The holdings of the Harvard Art Museums represent the lively eclecticism of this category of bronze, including busts of an empress type, a Minerva, an emperor and an ambiguous nude.   The basic shape of the bust weights was probably created from the lost-wax process, with later refinements added as the materials cooled. The hollow core was filled with lead to achieve the required weight, and a thin bronze sheet on the bottom capped the lead filling. Variations appear in the manufacture of different categories of the weights. The upper loop, with which the figure would be attached to the upper scale, was aligned in two different directions: the loop on the empress bust weights ran front-to-back, while the Minerva bust weights, in contrast, had a top loop that presents its circular face to the viewer. Furthermore, the Minerva weights possess rectangular socles, and the empress weights have oval socles.   NOTES:   1. For a fuller discussion of Byzantine steelyard dating, see A. L.

Drillmarks are visible.   Two genii stand on stylized bovine skulls (bucrania), and hold the fillets of a garland that runs across the front, below the inscription plate that they flank. Two ravens perch on the garland, their heads facing inward. The lid has a wreath and long fillets in the pediment, with floral akroteria on the corners.  The inscription reads:  DIS · MANIB ANNIAE · P · F · ISIADI ·  VIXIT · ANNIS / XVI · MENSIB ·  II · DIEB · XVII / P · CORNELIVS ·  P · L · MAMERTINVS / VIR ·  INFELICISSIMVS · FECIT / CONIVGI · DVLCI · FIDELI ·  PIAE / CONIVGALI · ET · SIBI   To the Manes of Annia who lived sixteen years, two months, seventeen days, daughter of Publius Isiadius. Publius Cornelius Mamertinus, freedman of Publius, a most unhappy husband, made (this tomb) for his sweet, faithful, and pious wife and for himself.   The design of genii, Amorini, or Erotes supporting the garland dates this urn in the Hadrianic or early Antonine periods (ca. A.D. 125-150) when garland-bearing children, with or without wings, were becoming standard on Roman sarcophagi. The composition is found on only a few cineraria, which were carved at the time when coffins for the body rather than urns for the ashes were becoming popular in the Classical world. A damaged example at Fenway Court shows the Erotes perched on Roman Imperial eagles of apotheosis (Vermeule, C., Cahn, Hadley, 1977, p. 40, no. 54 and further parallels). See also the urn of Lucius Antonius Dionysius at Castle Howard in Yorkshire (Oehler, 1980, p. 55, no. 23, pl. 84).   The bucrania as symbols of death were increasingly popular in Hadrian's reign, being a prominent feature on the rectangular base of his own mausoleum beside the Tiber.

The animal is rendered in a schematic style, with sharp, angular edges. It was composed of two concave pieces joined together with pins. A locking mechanism was originally positioned in the interior. The bolts were cast separately from the body. To close the lock, the bolt was inserted through one end of the animal’s body and secured at the other. The lock was opened by inserting a slide key through the animal’s chest. The key compressed a spring in the interior chamber to release the bolt (1).   Comparable slide key locks in the shape of animals are dated to a broad time span. A similar quadruped, possibly a goat, was found at Corinth and attributed to the eleventh or twelfth century. Cast in copper alloy, the figure has the same sharp edged, angular quality. It is embellished with incised lines and dots (2). Another cast copper alloy lock in the shape of a horse lacks surface decoration but has a comparable abstract, angular form. Its provenience and date are unknown (3). Other parallel objects raise the possibility that the Harvard lock was produced in a different cultural or chronological context. In particular, medieval and modern horse-shaped locks from Anatolia and Iran employ similar forms and mechanisms (4).   NOTES:   1.

The interior of the pyramid is hollow with a design consisting of two triangular areas at the bottom and a widened depression flanked by two smaller triangular areas, forming a stylized creature with four extremities and a head. When this piece came to Harvard, there was allegedly a small piece of gold leaf attached to it (1960.630.B). Said to be from Thessaly, this small stamp pendant fits well with a group of such objects from central and southern Greece. The purpose of a stamp seal of this type remains unclear. It could have been used for marking clay or wax sealings, or even for producing wax blanks in order to cast triangular bosses or pendants, which might have formed elements for a necklace or a belt.

304227,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This bronze handle belonged to a trefoil oinochoe, and a considerable remnant of the rim remains attached to the slot in the upper part of the handle. The handle consists of a vertical section, flat on the underside, convex on the outside, and marked by two parallel ridges running down the center. The top of the handle ends in a lion head that would have looked into the mouth of the vessel. It is flanked by two smaller, reclining lions whose bodies curve antithetically outward above the rim. They are carefully modeled in the round. Their curving tails, rendered in relief and ending in oval tufts, are placed symmetrically on either side of the back of the main lion head. The base plate consists of a large palmette of nine petals that grows out of a central space bounded by a curving ridge. On either side, serpents with their tails curled into volutes extend their heads upward and outward to fit the convex curve of the vessel’s shoulder. Two rivets, each placed through the snake’s back at a point just before the head projects from the handle, are preserved on the back of the handle. There appears to be a third rivet projecting from the underside of the left snake’s head. The snakes’ eyes are modeled in relief. The underside of each is marked by a shallow curving channel that extends almost to the tip of the head. The upper end of the base plate consists of a low convex band of beads or tongues, each separated by narrow ridges to form a transitional element from which the handle proper rises (1).   C. Stibbe has dated this handle to the second quarter of the sixth century BCE. The palmette type belongs to his “Ripe Style” (2). He cites a close parallel in a Lakonian black-figure vase in the Archäologisches Institut, University of Zurich, which he dates to c. 560 BCE (3). Therefore, this handle was probably produced by a Lakonian workshop active during the latter part of the first half of the sixth century BCE, or one at Tarantum, Sparta’s only colonial foundation in the west.

Tilted slightly to the right, the head is shaped like a long, narrow triangle. The antler’s first two points project vertically above the face. Two more backward-curving points are asymmetrically positioned along both antlers; each point terminates in a four-point double crescent formation. The upper right point at the end of the right antler has broken off. The front and hindquarters are pierced by holes c. 3 mm in diameter. A modern mounting element runs through the rear hole.   Harvard’s stag figurines probably represent male red or roe deer, wild species indigenous to the Caspian region of northwest Iran. These Asiatic deer, of which the red variety is larger, are known for their physical endurance, general robust nature, and environmental adaptability. Their most visually significant trait is their powerful antlers, which, shed and grown anew each year, are of maximum size and complexity when a deer is in its prime (1). A castrated fawn would never grow antlers, and those of an old stag would be short and simple. Thus, a buck bearing a large rack may be seen to epitomize sexual potency through his antlers, which are often used aggressively for fighting. Ancient Iranian deer figurines are consistently represented with exaggerated antlers, which may be interpreted as symbolizing ideal masculinity. Antlers are graceful sculptural elements, the stylization of which enhances the attractiveness of the figurines.   Stags are common in the artistic repertoire of northern Iran, where they are portrayed in a variety of media from the third millennium BCE through the Islamic period due to the long-established regional prominence of this animal. Deer figurines of the type represented by the Harvard pieces first appeared on the art market in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when they were acquired by museums and private collectors (2). According to dealers, these figurines had been discovered in the Caspian region of Iran. The systematic archaeological excavations that followed at the sites of Dailaman and Marlik produced several examples of these figurines from burial contexts (3). Archaeologists have dated these excavated pieces to c. 1000 BCE.   Both this example and 1978.506 are pierced, suggesting that they were worn as pendants or suspended in some other manner. It is not known whether they had merely a decorative function or fulfilled some other purpose.   NOTES:   1.

304238,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The head of this stag is in the shape of a rounded trapezoid, and its muzzle is blunt with an incised line representing the mouth. No eyes are indicated, but small ears flank the face, protruding from the sides of the head below the antlers. The antlers are relatively naturally proportioned, and each has three vertical points that terminate in a crescent formation, which adds two more points to each. This figurine has a sturdy upper body supported by delicate, slim legs. At the base of the neck, it is pierced by a small hole just large enough for a wire to pass through.   The small upper body piercing, relatively robust form, and inclusion of details such as ears and a mouth line recall the characteristics of a zebu in the Harvard collection (1978.504). It is possible that these northwestern Iranian objects belong to the same stylistic group, or are even derived from the same workshop. Interestingly, these pieces were purchased together—evidence that they may have been retrieved from the same unknown site.   Harvard’s stag figurines probably represent male red or roe deer, wild species indigenous to the Caspian region of northwest Iran. These Asiatic deer, of which the red variety is larger, are known for their physical endurance, general robust nature, and environmental adaptability. Their most visually significant trait is their powerful antlers, which, shed and grown anew each year, are of maximum size and complexity when a deer is in its prime (1). A castrated fawn would never grow antlers, and those of an old stag would be short and simple. Thus, a buck bearing a large rack may be seen to epitomize sexual potency through his antlers, which are often used aggressively for fighting. Ancient Iranian deer figurines are consistently represented with exaggerated antlers, which may be interpreted as symbolizing ideal masculinity. Antlers are graceful sculptural elements, the stylization of which enhances the attractiveness of the figurines.   Stags are common in the artistic repertoire of northern Iran, where they are portrayed in a variety of media from the third millennium BCE through the Islamic period due to the long-established regional prominence of this animal. Deer figurines of the type represented by the Harvard pieces first appeared on the art market in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when they were acquired by museums and private collectors (2). According to dealers, these figurines had been discovered in the Caspian region of Iran. The systematic archaeological excavations that followed at the sites of Dailaman and Marlik produced several examples of these figurines from burial contexts (3). Archaeologists have dated these excavated pieces to c. 1000 BCE.   Both this example and 1978.505 are pierced, suggesting that they were worn as pendants or suspended in some other manner. It is not known whether they had merely a decorative function or fulfilled some other purpose.   NOTES:   1.

304239,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This fragmentary relief bears a scene of a nude youth patting the head of a dog. The youth is seated on a rock or a pillar covered with cloth, as drapery appears to be rendered below his proper left thigh. The youth’s head is in profile, facing left, while his torso is turned in three-quarter view. His musculature is rendered rather naturalistically; his torso includes an extra fold at the navel. His hair is short and wavy. His nose, right ear, eye, and half of his mouth are modeled, while the rest of his face blends into the blank field behind his head. The youth’s proper left arm hangs by his side, with his index finger extended. His right arm reaches out to touch the head of a dog, facing right, with its muzzle lifted to touch the youth’s arm. The dog is shown in profile, with details of its head clearly modeled and part of its body visible below the fragmentary legs of the youth.   G. M. A. Hanfmann, in his 1947 article on this piece, noted the difficulties in determining its original function, whether it was a decorative component of a helmet’s cheek piece, a vase-handle attachment, or even a mirror cover (1). Although it is possible that this could be a fragment from a cheek piece, comparison with a very similar and better preserved mirror decoration showing a nude figure patting a dog in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, inv. no. Br 1716, indicates that this is more likely to be a mirror cover (2). The edges of some mirror cover fragments, including some still in situ on mirror discs, have curving borders that sometimes resemble cheek pieces (3). Depictions of youths with dogs also occur on marble grave stelai and may be signs that the young men are hunters (4).   NOTES:   1.

304243,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This unusual piece was found in the collection and accessioned in 1964, but nothing is known about how it came to be at Harvard (1). Three groups of objects are covered by this accession number: the main piece as assembled, a box of “ancient” fragments, and a box of “modern” fragments. The fragments were removed from the structure in 1998 (2). The main difference between the groups of fragments is a thick, white coating on the pieces labeled as modern. The group of modern fragments consists of twenty large fragments, all of which are slightly curved. The group of fragments designated as ancient consists of four large fragments. One is held together with tape, another is riveted together from several parts, and the other two have holes. One ancient rivet is kept in a vial, and there are dozens of smaller fragments.   The main structure of the object consists of sheet metal riveted to a substructure with cast teeth added. The back of the piece seems to form a hemispherical dome, perhaps replicating the top of a head, although it is currently open. Portions of what may be large, elliptical eyes in relief are visible on the edges of the opening, which situates the eyes more on top of the head than on the sides, although it is possible that the dome had been malformed after manufacture. The hemispherical dome is connected to structures forming the long snout of a carnivore. The cast teeth, with large upper and lower canines, do not correspond to any known mammal.   Although this object has been described previously as a helmet, perhaps used as part of a ritual, the interpretation of the object as a helmet depends greatly on the modern reconstruction (3). The closest comparanda for the upper part of the head are boar-head protomes on Etruscan chariots, which consist of the top section of boar heads, including the snout, eyes, ears, and sometimes crests, but not the lower jaws (4). These protomes covered the draft poles of chariots at the juncture of the pole and the main body of the chariot. It is possible that the eyes, top of the snout, and parts of the upper dome are ancient pieces from an Etruscan chariot, while other sections, such as the teeth, tongue, and nose piece, were added later to create a more cohesive piece.

304247,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This zebu has round horns, which are rendered as a single element flat across the crown and curving around toward each other at the points. On the neck between the horns, the shoulder hump is visible. No facial features are indicated, and the head terminates in a blunt muzzle. Square in profile, a dewlap extends down the throat as a slightly raised ridge. The body, pierced just behind the hump, is relatively long and slim with a short tail.   This horned and humped quadruped figure, along with 1969.177.24, represents a mature zebu, a domesticated species of Asiatic cattle (Bovis indicus) that can reach up to 10 feet in height. Zebus, used primarily as draft animals, are known for their resistance to heat, pestilence, and insects. Commonly used in Africa and the Asian monsoon belt, they are ideally suited to the Caspian region of Iran, which, situated between the Elburz Mountains and the sea, is a fertile lowland whose warm, sultry climate supports yearlong cultivation.   Copper alloy zebu figurines and pendants have been excavated from graves dated to the late second to early first millennia BCE at the site of Marlik in northwest Iran, which is just south of the Caspian Sea (1). Of all the types of animal figurines found at this site, zebus are most numerously represented. Some were found in pairs in association with model plows, alluding to their use as draft animals. A number of large hollow ceramic “vessels” in the form of zebus were also found in the graves. If these vessels are interpreted as ritual objects, they suggest zebus may have had some sacred association.   The motivations for depositing these figurines in graves and their possible symbolic meaning can only be inferred. The exaggeration of potent features such as the horns, hump, and genitalia may refer to power and strength. Some ceramic figurines of rams and stags are also given a hump, revealing the fascination with, if not the culturally significant value, of this feature. Zebus’ heartiness in harsh environmental conditions and their clear association with agriculture may suggest that they are linked to notions of earthly fecundity.   In addition to finds at the site of Marlik, comparable collections of zebu figurines and pendants have reportedly been retrieved throughout the western Caspian region of Iran, Russia, and Azerbaijan (2). An apparently shared tradition of iconography may point to a more or less cohesive cultural zone based on a shared environment in which zebus played a prominent role.   NOTES:   1. See E. O.

The legs are relatively short, and its raised tail curls forward over the back. This tail position is known from similar dog pendants, one of which was excavated from the Luristan site of Surkh-i Dum (1). A fine hole pierces this object through the body behind the front legs.   The long-domesticated dog served ancient cultures worldwide in hunting, warfare, security, and as a companion. Of the copper alloy pendants and figurines derived from Iran, examples in the form of dogs are abundant, although the corpus of excavated pieces is limited. Four dog figurines were found in a tomb at the site of Marlik in northwestern Iran, but these differ stylistically from the Harvard examples in their angular, elongated form and stiff stance (2). Dog figurines have been excavated from Iron Age III (800-750/700 BCE) contexts at the Luristan sanctuary site of Surkh-i Dum (3), which has been interpreted by excavators as having been a site dedicated to a female nature deity where hunters would have offered trinkets in hope or appreciation of success (4). In this context, canine figurines and pendants may represent hunting dogs. The Surkh-i Dum objects are close to the Harvard pieces stylistically, although those in the form of pendants are not pierced but have instead suspension loops. Despite this discrepancy in the method of suspension, which may have varied over time or from site to site, the available evidence favors the designation of the Harvard dog figurines as being from Luristan.

304265,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A male figure stands in a contrapposto pose, with his weight resting on his right leg. His left leg is bent, and the foot is drawn back. His right arm hangs down away from his body, while his left hand bends forward and slightly down. He turns his large head to the right, the direction of his weight-bearing leg. His massively modeled body, with broad chest, high epigastric arch, protruding abdomen, and prominently muscled inguinal ridge, are compellingly reminiscent of the modeling visible in copies of Polykleitos’ Doryphoros. His nipples are small pointed protrusions, his navel is a tiny depression, and his genitalia are naturalistically modeled. The sides of his buttocks are slightly depressed, and the muscles of his back are shown to be well developed. His sturdy legs, with naturalistic knees, are well modeled. His fingers and toes are defined by incisions. The bottoms of the feet, from the big toe to the arch of the foot, resemble the soles of sandals.    Tips of rivets or pegs project from the feet; the left rivet or peg projects just behind the big toe, while the right projects from the heel. The position of the bent index finger of the left hand was caused by later damage. A prominent rectangular patch on the left shoulder, a brownish metallic color that is lighter than the surrounding shoulder, has been painstakingly dressed down in the final cold working stage.   The youth’s hair is a tight-fitting cap that extends around the base of his head. His right ear is summarily modeled, while the left ear is not rendered. There are traces of vertical locks around his left cheek in front of where his ear would have been, and there are faint traces of horizontal incisions just above the lower edge of the hair on his forehead.    The bulky modeling and clearly articulated stance of this youth connect him closely to the style and mood of Polykleitos’ early work. The cap-like hair, however, retains the characteristics of earlier transitional and Early Classical male coiffures, such as those worn by Herakles on the metopes from the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. Furthermore, the proportions of the youth’s head—broad at the top with a very shallowly convex crown—strongly recall the proportions and volumes of the Doryphoros (1).   NOTES:   1. Compare H.

304295,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The catch of this triangular fibula is partially broken off, and due to heavy accretions, the decoration on the bow is difficult to discern. The molded elements on either side of the central bend may have consisted of two collared ribs or two large biconical or tri-ridged beads. Due to the poor condition, it is not possible to suggest parallels for this piece with any certainty, but a comparison can possibly be made with a simple double beaded Neo-Assyrian fibula excavated from the Northwest Palace at Nimrud, probably dating to the seventh century BCE (1). A similar object, on which the beads are collared, was excavated at the northwest Iranian site of Hasanlu from a tomb dated to the fifth to fourth centuries BCE (2).    Fibulae were worn at the chest or shoulder to fasten garments, similar to a safety pin. They sometimes also served to secure pendants suspended from chains (3). These devices first came into use in the Near East near the end of the second millennium BCE, when they were probably introduced by eastern Mediterranean merchants. The earliest fibulae excavated in Mesopotamia and Iran are dated to the eighth century BCE. Fibulae appear more frequently in Near Eastern contexts of the seventh century and later, when they surpassed the straight pin in popularity. Most Near Eastern fibulae have a triangular bow, as seen in the Harvard examples. Fibulae of this form, sometimes referred to as “elbow” -shaped, belong to Type XIII of Blinkenberg’s classification and to Types III and IV of Stronach’s typology (4).   Near Eastern elbow fibulae vary in size and detail, but in general, they are relatively plain and usually have bead-and-reel decoration. The arms of the bow are often of slightly unequal lengths, with the longer one terminating in a catchplate that sometimes takes the form of a human hand. The spring typically consists of a triple loop that extends into a round, tapered, and pointed pin. Fibulae were often produced from two pieces that were joined by inserting the pin into the bow.   The Harvard fibulae can be generally compared with Neo-Assyrian examples from the Mesopotamian sites of Nimrud, Nineveh, and Khorsabad, as well as with Iranian examples from Iron Age III levels at the Luristan sites of War Kabud, Sar Kabud, Cham Sul, Dam Chaft, and Tepe Nush-i Jan, among others (5). Although separate production centers probably existed, it appears Mesopotamia and Iran used similar fibula types, making it difficult to assign provenience to unexcavated pieces (6).   NOTES:   1. D.

Whereas most seated figures rest on a chair or a stool above the base, the Harvard figure is positioned directly on the base. Where the buttocks and base meet, the bronze is seamless with no continuation of the edge of the base. A smooth, subtly undulating line runs from the crown of the head down the back to the buttocks, where it continues along the edge of the base to the front, before it turns up to the knees and then down again to the hip flexors. The unarticulated feet, set in front of the figure, curve inward and are flush with the leading edge of the base. The chest rises at the breastbone, and then tapers inward to the genitalia, which are only roughly indicated. Such indeterminate sexual anatomy is unusual in Geometric male figurines; a number of other seated and standing statuettes are clearly ithyphallic. The figure’s modeling is thick and rounded overall. The elbows rest on the knees, and the fists rest on the figure’s cheeks. The right arm is held slightly higher than the left.   This seated figure has many characteristics in common with the other twelve known examples of this figurine type, yet it also differs from them in significant ways (1). When viewed from either side, the figure is triangular.

The underside features two parallel ridges and a valley, with a deeper indentation in the center. The top is more uneven and resembles a real knucklebone. The rounded knobs on one end are parallel, but uneven, with one being larger than the other. Copper alloy replicas of astragaloi occur in many collections of antiquities (1). Astragaloi of various mammals were used as gaming pieces for a variety of different games throughout the ancient world (2), and sets of the bones often occur in Greek graves of the fifth and fourth centuries BCE.

A motif in the form of an elongated C-shape open at the top embellishes the lower field, and the perimeter is enhanced with delicate raised dots, inside of which runs a finely incised double line.    Two sets of perforations, one near the tail and one below the oval motif, interrupt the repoussé dots. Additional perforations may have been situated at equal distances around the original edge. Stitching (or possibly pins) through the double perforations could have attached the roundel to a larger object or garment.    Luristan, Parthian, and Italic origins have been suggested for an array of decorated bronze discs; no objects of this type derive from Near Eastern archaeological contexts (1).

304314,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A double molding separates the lion mask from the hoop, which is of elliptical section and slightly flattened on the inside. Two curved grooves appear on the underside of the mask, in the section that outlines the eyes.    The highly stylized lion mask appears to have been the invention of Luristan metal smiths. It is essentially a flattened top view of a feline’s head. Folds of skin surround the eyes like goggles; the nose and upper part of the muzzle are added on one end, and two rounded ears perk up on the other. Such masks appear as finials on bracelets and pins, such as 164.1972, and as junctures on pins with open-cast heads and halberd axes, such as 1943.1318 (1).   Lion-headed bracelets are well known from representations, and some originals survive from the early first millennium BCE. In most cases, the finials are full heads rather than masks, but masks occur on a pair of gold bracelets from a Neo-Assyrian royal burial at Nimrud dated to the second half of the eighth century BCE (2). Closest to the Luristan bracelets is the ornament worn by king Adda-Hamiti-Inshushinak of Elam on a relief fragment from Susa (3). A traditional symbol of power, the lion was often an attribute of the king. The popularity of lion masks on the Luristan bronzes suggests that larger sections of the population used this imagery, although it cannot be excluded that it was reserved for objects intended for dedication to a deity. The relief from Susa indicates that lion-mask bracelets were current in the Elamite realm in the mid-seventh century BCE.    The Harvard fragments are all of different sizes. The smallest head, 1969.177.35.2, also differs stylistically from the others, in that its multiple eyebrows form a continuous line with the nose, separating the face into two halves. This is the more common rendering. The other three finials are modeled very cursorily. The chemical composition suggests that fragments 1969.177.36.A, 1969.177.36.B, and 1969.177.36.C may indeed have come from the same bracelet, even though the seemingly ancient breaks do not match well and the two heads differ in size. Alternatively, they may be fragments from different bracelets, but may have been made from the same batch of metal. The similarity in style and workmanship of the heads leaves little doubt that these were made by the same craftsman (4).   NOTES:   1. Compare P. R. S.

It has a lustrous green patina. Part of an incised guilloche band, framed by tiny beads, is preserved at the bottom of the break. A second guilloche, framed by tiny beads bounded by raised, horizontal ridges, extends around the mouth of the vessel. A band of tongues extends completely around the rim of the spout and passes under the attachment for the handle.    The handle, cast in one piece and concave in profile, consists of a central ridge, widening into a facet that extends to the back of the silenus head facing into the spout. The smaller, upper silenus, with a broad nose and large oval eyes, peers into the spout. The ends of his long outward-curving moustache extend to the edge of his beard.    The lower terminal of the handle, by which it was attached to the shoulder of the oinochoe, ends in a larger satyr head, which has similar facial features and details to the smaller silenus head. A horizontal groove separates the bottom of the handle from the top of the satyr’s hair. This face exhibits the same bulging tear-shaped pupils surrounded by raised eyelids as the head at the rim. The satyr’s pointed animal ears, modeled by deep tear-shaped grooves, curve along the outer contours of his hair. There are traces of five or six large beads at the outer sides of the base of the handle. The attachment of the silenus head is concave on the rear, so that it would fit closely to the contour of the shoulder of the vessel.    This magnificent fragmentary ensemble comes from one of the finest examples of a type of beak-spouted oinochoe that was extremely popular during the fifth through the early third centuries BCE in both Italy and northern Greece (1). The painstakingly rendered guilloche and the vigorous modeling of the silenus heads suggest that this piece originated in a Campanian or even Latin workshop during the first half of the fifth century BCE (2).

The bust appears to represent Dionysos wearing an animal skin that is fastened over his left shoulder, leaving the right exposed, and a diadem or crown with leaves and flowers. The animal skin is folded on its upper border and is secured by a knot, with the animal’s feet hanging over the left shoulder; tufts of fur are incised on the surface. The god is beardless, and his wavy hair is swept back from his face. The face is well modeled, with detailed eyes, a thin nose, and the lips of the mouth pressed closed. The head turns slightly down and toward the left shoulder, while the arms sink into the handle, ending just below the shoulders. The bust is bordered by a plain band, and a triangular palmette extends from the bottom.    The top of the handle is piriform and curves where it attached to the vessel. The handle is oblong in section. An area of incised lines appears directly below the upper terminal, followed by three horizontal beaded rows, the lower of which continues down each side. Within the beaded borders are the head of a bearded satyr in profile, his pointed ears deeply recessed, and a woven basket filled with globular objects with central circles, perhaps fruit or flowers.

304322,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The solid-cast bronze openwork globe is surmounted by a deer standing on a narrow, rectangular platform. The upper and lower zones of the biconical globe are divided by a horizontal band whose incised decoration, consisting of alternating groups of diagonal lines, is visible from the back where corrosion is minimal. Areas of corrosion are especially extensive on the front of the globe. Each hemisphere of the globe is pierced with eight triangular openings. A casting error on the lower half, directly in line with the front legs of the deer, creates an imperfect divide between two triangles. A stem and decorative disc project from the bottom of the globe. Below the disc is a slight projection notched into four segments, which could represent a blossom, perhaps from a pomegranate. At the top of the globe, a short column supports a narrow undecorated, rectangular base on which stands a deer or stag. The head of the animal turns to the left, while its slender muzzle turns lightly downward. Raised pellets represent the eyes. The root of the left antler is preserved, but the right is completely missing. The left ear projects horizontally backward; only the stump of the right ear remains. The deer’s front and back legs merge into two supports; the hind legs rest slightly to the left of the base. The body is horizontal and has no surface decoration; it ends in a stubby tail.    Openwork globes with quadruped finials as dedications in Greek sanctuaries and as personal jewelry have been found in Balkan graves (1). An interesting parallel to the Harvard piece—a biconical globe pierced with four triangles in each half and surmounted by a horse, provenience unknown—is attributed by J.-L. Zimmermann to a Macedonian workshop of the Sub-geometric period (2). The Harvard example may be attributed to a Macedonian workshop of the Late Geometric period.   NOTES:   1.

Its barrel-shaped body is supported by front and hind legs whose upper muscular definition is stylized and marked with ridges at the front of the hindquarters and the back of the forequarters. A small tail hangs downward, curving inward slightly. The bull’s head extends horizontally forward. It is marked at the top by a raised ridge of hair, incised with cross-hatching. The stubs of both horns are visible, projecting outward above small tab-like ears. The muzzle extends vertically downward. A pronounced dewlap runs from under the chin to the top of the forelegs. The front hooves and right back hoof project forward and are marked by horizontal grooves below the shafts of the legs. The genitalia are prominent.   The rectangular base is missing its front edge. The back edge has been bent and curved upward. A perforation is visible in the break at the right rear corner of the base; a second perforation occurs behind the left front leg. The edge of a third perforation appears in the left edge of the break at the front of the base. Six round or oval pits mark the middle section of the base, extending to just in front of the left rear leg.   The surface of the bull itself appears uniformly shiny. It is unclear whether this is a result of drastic stripping of corrosion products from the surface followed by repatination, or if the object is a modern piece (see Technical Observations). Stylistically, it is consistent with other votive statuettes of bulls from the second half of the sixth century or the early fifth century BCE. Nevertheless, the possibility that this is a modern object cannot be ruled out.   David G. Mitten",NULL,NULL

Sculpted in the round, the mouflons’ heads are turned to face the viewer. Tall ears stand erect in front of their horizontally incised horns. Their faces feature applied bead eyes and incised mouth lines. Their front haunches are defined by an indentation, which is higher and more prominent on this piece. Perhaps to accommodate the bit hole, the front halves of their torsos expand outward below the neck and at the belly (50.1965.2 is more angular in this regard). Their torsos then curve up to a narrow waist, and slender tails fall from the back of the hindquarters. The legs on these mouflons might be slightly thickened to suggest that one leg is directly behind another; nonetheless, it is unusual that only two legs are articulated—typically zoomorphic cheek pieces show all four legs, as if the animal were advancing (1).    The centers of the mouflons’ torsos are punctuated by bit holes (1.8 cm in diameter) that are circumscribed by a ridge. Loops emerge on the top edge of the rear haunch and from behind the head; two conical spikes also project from the concave reverse. The groundline and part of the front leg of this piece are restored.   Cheek pieces are components of equestrian gear that were worn on either side of a horse’s mouth (2). They are identified by a central hole through which a bit would have been secured. Cheek straps would have passed through loops at the top, and spikes on the undecorated reverse would have helped control the horse by digging into its cheeks.    Cast zoomorphic cheek pieces may have adorned, protected, and goaded horses. However, it is not clear that this gear was used or if it served specifically as funerary adornment in horse burials, as grave goods in human burials, or as votive objects (3). Although many cheek pieces are attributed to Luristan, no elaborate figural examples come from archaeological contexts (4). Simpler cheek pieces and harness components, however, have been excavated at various first-millennium BCE Iranian sites, including Hasanlu, Giyan, and Sialk (5).    Luristan-style zoomorphic cheek pieces typically feature obverse relief depictions of an animal striding on a groundline facing the direction in which the horse itself would have advanced. Horses, mouflons, and griffins, among other creatures, are represented—variations in imagery may have reflected the identity of the horse or rider, as well as regional and temporal differences.    Because right and left cheek pieces were made from separate molds and no in situ examples have been excavated, it is problematic to attempt to reconstruct matched pairs. Among the abundant figural cheek pieces classified as Luristan are probable forgeries and aftercasts (6).   NOTES:   1. See P. R. S.

304386,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This solid-cast bronze figurine is of a type formerly known as “bottle stoppers” (Kannenverschlüsse), now identified as a variety of decorative belt pendant (1). The Harvard example features a monkey-like seated figure holding an indeterminate object to its mouth, while beneath it descends a rod decorated with vertical rows of knobs or buttons. The highly stylized figure has tightly contracted knees and no feet. The elbows and knees are counterpoised. The right knee is slightly higher, and the right forearm slightly shorter, than their counterparts on the left. The forearms rise at an oblique angle to the level of the face, where the hands hold an object directly against the end of a long snout. The back of the head is flat and wide, with two round protruding ears. The shapes from the back of the head to the hands are two confronting triangles, which meet at the juncture of the snout and the object held against it. The entire back from shoulders to buttocks is also constructed as two confronting triangles that meet at the mid-back. The top of the figure from head to hands and the bottom from hips to the ends of the legs are perfectly straight, parallel lines. The vertical line from the head to the buttocks is also perfectly straight, so that when viewed from the side the figure has the shape of an openwork rectangle. From the front, the legs and arms taper inward to the hands, framing the long sides of an isosceles triangle.    The figure sits on a platform or base that is 1.0 cm square. The base is supported by a short column whose lower end flares out into a flat disc. Beneath the disc hangs a rod decorated with four vertical rows of knobs, four in each row, sixteen altogether. A single knob caps the bottom of the rod. There is a modern hole in the base. The second knob from the bottom, in the row of knobs beneath the left hip of the figure, is very small due to a casting fault. The other knobs are similar but not uniform in size. Considerable corroded material adheres between all the knobs and the rod from which they extend. The entire piece is smoothly finished. The patina is greenish black with some lighter green patches. A close parallel to this piece is in the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Kassel (2).    NOTES:   1. For examples, see U.

Approximately one-half of the circumference is undecorated. The lower portion, near the terminals, consists of five beads separated by saddle shapes. Additional curvilinear decoration appears on some of the beads. The terminals have an oblate shape, and there is some accretion material visible in the concavities. On the back of the terminals are hatched lines that extend up to the last raised ridge. The top and bottom of the terminals are encircled by raised bands with vertical incision marks, giving the bands a rope-like appearance.   The overall decoration and sizes of bracelets 1992.312, 1992.313, 1992.314, and 1992.315, along with this torc, are similar enough to each other that these objects could have been made in the same workshop, perhaps by the same artisan. A very similar torc and bracelets were found in a tomb at Mainz-Linsenberg and are dated to the fourth century BCE (1).   Torcs were an ornament, generally worn around the neck, by men and women as well as gods. (2). Although torcs were used over a broad geographical area and temporal period, ancient authors mention them with relative frequency in relation to groups of people traditionally identified as Celts (3).

304412,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This completely preserved statuette is similar to 1955.129, although somewhat less subtle in its modeling. The shroud pulls up in a slight ridge around the back of the shoulders, over which falls the counterpoise of the broad collar. Details of the broad collar, headdress, crook, and flail are rendered by incision. Slits for the arms to emerge from the garment are visible; the hands are arranged one above the other. The atef crown has the projecting ram's horns; a small piece of the proper right side of the ram’s horn is broken, probably not recently in light of the black and green corrosion covering it (1). The numerous marks visible on the face, garment, headdress, and reverse of the headdress may indicate previously unrecorded cleaning to remove accretions.   Osiris was one of the most popular gods of the Egyptian pantheon. Early in Egyptian history he represented a chthonic fertility god that later acquired the royal insignia of the crook and flail. He came to be identified as the ruler of the underworld. The Egyptian ruler, perceived during his lifetime as the incarnation of Horus, became Osiris after death. Over time, Osiris was equated with all deceased individuals and became a symbol of resurrection. The major cult shrine of Osiris was at Abydos in Middle Egypt, where Seti I (c. 1294-1279 BCE) built a magnificent temple in Dynasty 19.   Small bronze figurines representing Osiris show the god wrapped in a form-fitting garment, perhaps denoting a mummified shroud, and carrying the symbols of rulership—the crook and flail—in each hand. Enveloped in his shroud, Osiris’ arms are bound close to his body and his feet and legs stand together. The god is usually depicted wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt, ornamented with a uraeus (cobra) on the front and sometimes flanked by two feathers (the atef crown). In addition, this crown can rest on a set of spiraling ram’s horns that project to either side.    The bronze figurines take two basic forms: seated or standing. Within each group, several subgroups can be distinguished according to the placement of the hands. The hands can be side-by-side without overlapping, the proper right hand above the left in a vertical alignment, or crossed over one another at the wrists. G. Roeder associates the different poses to geographical areas within Egypt: those with hands side-by-side in Middle Egypt, those with hands one above the other in Lower Egypt, and those with the hands crossed over one another in Upper Egypt (2). The position of the hands also appears to correlate with other broad stylistic features. For example, the ridge created by the shroud pulled around the shoulders occurs primarily on figurines in which the hands are arranged one above the other.   NOTES:        1.

The molding consists of four biconical beads interspersed with pairs of rings. Incised decoration may have been present but is now obliterated by corrosion. The tip of the pin is lost.    Pins from Luristan generally have round shafts that taper to a point. The pin head is often zoomorphic, and a common type of finial represents a swimming duck. A series of convex and concave moldings forms the transition from the duck-shaped finial to the shaft, which may be incised with geometric patterns below the moldings. As is well illustrated by the examples at Harvard, the known pins of this kind are quite similar but vary in minor details and proportions. This would suggest that the majority of these objects were cast in a direct lost-wax process, but raised seams visible on the duck of 167.1972 indicate that either the bronze itself or, more likely, the wax model was cast in a two-piece mold (1).   Pins with heads in the form of swimming ducks have been excavated in a tomb at Kutal-i Gulgul dated to the Iron Age I period (1300/1250-1150 BCE) and the Surkh Dum-i Luri sanctuary, dated to the Iron Age III period (800/750-650 BCE). From these contexts, it may be concluded that pins of this type remained in use for several centuries, from the late second to the early first millennia BCE.

It is patterned after ground stone prototypes. These axes are cast. They taper from the corners of the cutting edge toward the rounded butt at the opposite end. Both axes have convexly curving cutting edges, with one face beveled down to the edge and squared-off, vertical sides. Both also have a dark brownish surface covered in some areas with a rough greenish gray. The surface of one axe (1992.256.133) is strangely pitted on one side. It is not clear whether this preserves the original metal surface, or if the pitting is part of the incrustation products that cover the original surface. The close similarity of these two objects suggests that they may have been part of a larger horde of such axes, perhaps used for barter or exchange. It is unclear whether these objects were meant to be used by themselves, or were inserted into the ends of wooden or bone handles. It is also unclear whether they were tools for cutting, shaving, or smoothing wood.    NOTES:   1. Axes generally similar in shape from the collections of the Royal Ontario Museum are published in J.

304534,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This axe-head, currently made up of a blade, shaft hole, and a molded head decoration, was discovered to be a pastiche during examination in conservation. A molded collar, 1992.256.137.B, has also been added to the top of the shaft; it is unclear whether this element is modern or if it may have belonged to another ancient object. The molded collar was removed, along with some of the filling covering the joins on the axe-head.   While the form and iconographic style of this axe-head are related to the Luristan bronze tradition, no figural parallels are known among axe-heads. Shaft-hole axe-heads are primarily associated with third-millennium BCE Mesopotamian and Iranian contexts, but these examples lack figural embellishment (1). The janiform heads adorning this object are of the same style seen on early first-millennium BCE Luristan tubes and finials, but they are not attested on axes (2). The heads on the Harvard axe-head are very worn and broken off at the top, and it is possible that they are also modern additions; ICP-MS/AAA analysis of the three currently joined components indicates that the decorative heads have a different alloy (bronze) than the blade or the shaft (both arsenical copper). A small linear design is etched on one side of the blade.   NOTES:   1. See P. R. S.

The head knob was made separately and attached, while the lateral knobs seem to be integral with the crossbar. Beaded borders separate the knobs from the crossbar. The crossbar is rectangular in section, and it is decorated on the top by a series of raised ridges. The separately made pin is attached to the fibula by a hinge that is secured to a wire rod inserted through the crossbar. The bow of this example is decorated by a row of punched chevrons; an additional beaded border is present at the juncture of the bow with the catchplate. The row of punched chevrons continues on the long catchplate, with six circles—two near the bow and four near the foot—with short linear borders flanking the row.   Crossbow fibulae were used in the Roman world from the third through sixth centuries CE (2). The distinctive fasteners, often decorated with prominent onion-shaped knobs, may have been status symbols, as indicated by examples in gold and the famous relief of the fourth-century Roman general Stilicho in Mantua, where crossbow fibulae are clearly rendered on the shoulders of the general and his son (3).

Pins of the same type, commonly pierced and bearing incised decoration, have been excavated at several sites in northwestern Iran and were apparently used over an extended period of time in the Bronze and early Iron Ages, from the mid-third to the early first millennium BCE (1). At Marlik, carefully crafted examples in gold were found (2). The hole may once have contained a wire hoop or piece of string, intended to attach the pin to the dress it fastened or to hold an additional ornament or utensil (3).   NOTES:   1. See L.

It is patterned after ground stone prototypes. These axes are cast. They taper from the corners of the cutting edge toward the rounded butt at the opposite end. Both axes have convexly curving cutting edges, with one face beveled down to the edge and squared-off, vertical sides. Both also have a dark brownish surface covered in some areas with a rough greenish gray. The surface of one axe (1992.256.133) is strangely pitted on one side. It is not clear whether this preserves the original metal surface, or if the pitting is part of the incrustation products that cover the original surface. The close similarity of these two objects suggests that they may have been part of a larger horde of such axes, perhaps used for barter or exchange. It is unclear whether these objects were meant to be used by themselves, or were inserted into the ends of wooden or bone handles. It is also unclear whether they were tools for cutting, shaving, or smoothing wood.    NOTES:   1. Axes generally similar in shape from the collections of the Royal Ontario Museum are published in J.

The muzzle is conical, and no eyes are indicated. Viewed frontally, this figure is of the same form as 1992.256.34. The body, supported by short legs, is heavy and low to the ground. No tail is defined, but the upward curve of the rump may give the impression of one.   A hole, small in the front and expanding in diameter to c. 1 cm in the back, runs through the neck from the throat to the nape. The opening at the back of the neck is linked to the hollow body below through a very fine passage, which opens in a large hole at the rear of the figure. With this unusual hollow form, the pendant could have been strung through the entire body and neck, allowing it to be suspended levelly.   The long-domesticated dog served ancient cultures worldwide in hunting, warfare, security, and as a companion. Of the copper alloy pendants and figurines derived from Iran, examples in the form of dogs are abundant, although the corpus of excavated pieces is limited. Four dog figurines were found in a tomb at the site of Marlik in northwestern Iran, but these differ stylistically from the Harvard examples in their angular, elongated form and stiff stance (1). Dog figurines have been excavated from Iron Age III (800-750/700 BCE) contexts at the Luristan sanctuary site of Surkh-i Dum (2), which has been interpreted by excavators as having been a site dedicated to a female nature deity where hunters would have offered trinkets in hope or appreciation of success (3). In this context, canine figurines and pendants may represent hunting dogs. The Surkh-i Dum objects are close to the Harvard pieces stylistically, although those in the form of pendants are not pierced but have instead suspension loops. Despite this discrepancy in the method of suspension, which may have varied over time or from site to site, the available evidence favors the designation of the Harvard dog figurines as being from Luristan.

310530,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This figure of an offerand or priest holds a pyxis in his left hand. His left arm is bent at the elbow. The right arm, which is missing from just above the elbow, was extended outward and would have held a patera in its hand. His large head is turned to his right. The hair is depicted as sausage-like lumps above the forehead and at the sides of the face; the effect is reminiscent of Hellenistic art derived from portraits of Alexander. He wears a six-pointed foliate crown tied by a ribbon at the back of the head. The facial features are summarily indicated, with large eyes that are not detailed by punches or lines. His weight was on his left leg, which is missing from above the knee. The right leg, which is missing below the garment, would have been slightly behind the left leg. He wears a knee-length cloak draped over his left shoulder and diagonally across the back, secured in a roll around his waist and looped over his left arm, leaving the upper torso and right side of his back bare. The remains of gilding on the back of the cloak are unlikely to be original (1). The figure is very slender, with little modeling other than what can be seen on the right arm and left buttocks.   This type derives from examples said to have been found at Lake Nemi, such as the votive statuettes representing sacrificing youths in the British Museum, London, who hold an incense box in their left hands, pour a libation from a patera in their outstretched right hands, and wear the same draped toga (2). There are other Hellenistic examples from Etruria and Latium. Many have been found among dedications at sanctuaries. The leafy headdress found on some examples, which may have connected the pieces to a Dionysian cult, has been simplified to a six-pointed crown on the Harvard piece. In addition to the Dionysian association, the discovery of two similar pieces in the excavation of a private house at Vetulonia suggests they were also associated with a domestic cult (3).   The Harvard priest is one of the many mass-produced examples of male and female votives dedicated at sanctuaries mainly in central Italy but also in Gaul and Germany. In spite of the cursory execution, the figure’s hairstyle and animated face are representative of a central Italian style that fused late Etruscan, Hellenistic, and Roman art (4).   NOTES:   1.

Unlike other examples at Harvard, the knobs in this case are integral to the bow and crossbar. The head knob is separated from the bow by a simple collar; the knobs on the crossbar are each preceded by two thin discs. The crossbar is heptagonal in section, and there is a small step prior to its connection with the bow on each side. The separately made pin is attached to the fibula by a hinge that is secured to a wire rod inserted through the crossbar; the rod protrudes through the end of the left-side knob. The bow of this example is undecorated; it is indented at the juncture with the catchplate. The relatively short catchplate is faceted on the top and has two horizontal ridges near the foot.   Crossbow fibulae were used in the Roman world from the third through sixth centuries CE (2). The distinctive fasteners, often decorated with prominent onion-shaped knobs, may have been status symbols, as indicated by examples in gold and the famous relief of the fourth-century Roman general Stilicho in Mantua, where crossbow fibulae are clearly rendered on the shoulders of the general and his son (3).

The shaft is twisted so that the spatula and scoop are set at 90 degrees to each other. There is a large, bead-shaped rib at each end of the shaft near the spatula and scoop. The spatula is wider at the tip and tapers slightly to the shaft. Scratches are visible on the inside of the scoop and at the spatula’s base.   Greek and Roman medical instruments, many of which were described by ancient authors, have been found, sometimes in sets, throughout the ancient world (1). The instruments could have been used for more than one function, making precise classification difficult in some instances. A spatula is a probe with one flattened, spatula-shaped end and a probe on the other used for stirring and applying medicines, among other uses (2). Spatulae are among the most common instrument types (3). Scoop probes could be used for stirring and applying medicines, cleaning ears or other, including cosmetic, uses (4).    NOTES:   1. J. S.

310797,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The warrior stands frontally, feet on a circular base, with a dagger held to his chest (1). The top of his head is smooth and round, and it is encircled by a band or diadem. There are looped coils around the back of the head, indicating hair or styled braids. His facial features are elongated and rather flat. The wide eyes are incised, while the nose and mouth are modeled. The features from his forehead to the bottom of his nose are slightly raised from the base level of the face, giving the figure the appearance of wearing a mask. The man is clad in a short V-neck tunic. The short sleeves are decorated with molded bands above the elbow, and the hem has a wide, incised herringbone pattern. The narrow waist is encircled by a wide belt with molded bands on the back and a large rectangular clasp on the front (2). He holds his left arm pressed against his side, completely joined to the torso. His palm is placed on his left hip with fingers splayed. The upper right arm is also pressed against his side and part of his torso; the arm is bent upward at the elbow, and the figure clenches a dagger, possibly unfinished, in his right fist and holds it diagonally across his chest. The legs are completely separated below the hem of the tunic and are modeled in the round. The lower legs are rather muscular compared to the other Iberian statuettes. His knees are slightly indicated, and the leg tapers toward the ankles. His feet are pressed flat on the circular base, which is integral with the figure (3). Separate toes are indicated by incision. When upright, the figure appears to lean forward (4). The statuette is modeled in the round.   Thousands of small, anthropomorphic copper alloy statuettes and anatomical votives have been recovered from remote sanctuary sites in south-central Spain, particularly Collado de los Jardines and Castellar de Santisteban, but it is not certain to which god or gods they were dedicated (5). Many of the statuettes depict individuals, some of whom are represented in poses of prayer or offering (6). Some are very abstract and schematically rendered, while others wear identifiable contemporary clothing (7). In spite of the similarity of the votives, there is nothing to indicate that the intention behind each offering was the same. This example is most likely from the cave sanctuary of Collado de los Jardines near Santa Elena, Jaén. It was given to Harvard in 1933 by the Republic of Spain in exchange for the cover of the eleventh-century sarcophagus of Alfonso Ansúrez from Sahagún, León, which was then in the collection of the Fogg Art Museum (8).   NOTES:   1. The best comparison is F. Álvarez-Ossorio, Catalogo de los exvotos de bronce, ibericos, Museo Arqueologico Nacional (Madrid, 1941) no. 222, pl. 36, although it is on a square base.    2. An epitome describing the Iberians preserved from Nicholas of Damascus’ universal history notes that the Iberians had a belt of a certain size, and it was considered unseemly if anyone could not fit in it; see Nicolai Damasceni Historiarum excerpta et fragmenta quae supersunt Graece (Lipsiae/Leipzig, 1804) 142-45 “Iberi/Ιβηροι.” The first-century BCE geographer Strabo has a longer description of this custom. He remarks that another geographer, Ephorus, extended the boundaries of the Celts too far and included the Iberians, and then he notes that these people “take great care not to become too fat or big-bellied, and that if any young man exceeds the measure of a certain girdle, he is punished” (Strabo, 4.4.6). Despite the confusion about whether this anecdote refers to the Celts or the Iberians, this detail appears to correspond to the account of Nicholas and is illustrated by the attire of statuettes like this one.   3.

310802,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This female orant wears a low, curved, and uncovered headdress that seems to be made of three plain bands (1). The back of the headdress is featureless and slightly concave. Her brow is quite prominent below the front of the headdress. Her facial features are molded and very large, particularly the eyes and jutting nose. Her chin is small and curved. There is a prominence on each side of the head that may indicate ears or part of the decorations on the headdress. She wears a long form-fitting dress with short sleeves. Either the dress has a decorative collar, or the statuette wears a necklace. The back of the dress has a crisscross decoration that might be a rendering of the same circular, looped band worn by 1933.134. Bracelets or cuffs are modeled above the elbows and indicated by incision at the wrists. The dress narrows somewhat at the waist, flaring out slightly down to the ankles and leaving the feet uncovered. A slight train covers her heels. Her arms are extremely long and thin; they are completely separate from the upper body, bending at the elbows with both hands held palm downward on her chest. Separate fingers are slightly indicated with incision. Her feet are large and block-like, with a groove on the top and bottom to indicate their separation.   Thousands of small, anthropomorphic copper alloy statuettes and anatomical votives have been recovered from remote sanctuary sites in south-central Spain, particularly Collado de los Jardines and Castellar de Santisteban, but it is not certain to which god or gods they were dedicated (2). Many of the statuettes depict individuals, some of whom are represented in poses of prayer or offering (3). Some are very abstract and schematically rendered, while others wear identifiable contemporary clothing (4). In spite of the similarity of the votives, there is nothing to indicate that the intention behind each offering was the same. This example is most likely from the cave sanctuary of Collado de los Jardines near Santa Elena, Jaén. It was given to Harvard in 1933 by the Republic of Spain in exchange for the cover of the eleventh-century sarcophagus of Alfonso Ansúrez from Sahagún, León, which was then in the collection of the Fogg Art Museum (5).

A small, raised circle on the wall of the bowl is visible on both the exterior and interior. The bowl is otherwise plain and smooth on both sides. A series of circular depressions appear on the top of the molded edge. The prominent molding on the sides of the bowl may have once been symmetrical, but now one side is better preserved than the other; the prongs on the edge opposite the spout also appear to have been broken.   There is not full agreement on what role this type of object fulfilled. It has been suggested that these were used for filling oil lamps (2), where the small spout would aid in directing valuable lamp oil into small fill holes, although it has also been suggested that they are “cosmetic mortars” (3).

The knobs may have been made separately and attached; beaded borders separate the extant knobs from the crossbar. The crossbar is rectangular in section, and it is decorated on the top by a series of raised beaded bands. The separately made pin (now missing) was attached to the fibula by a hinge that was secured to a wire rod inserted through the crossbar; the rod protrudes through the ends of the knobs. The bow of this example bears an incised lattice pattern with a double border on each side; additional molded collars are present at the juncture of the bow with the catchplate. The lattice pattern is repeated without the double border on the catchplate, and eight circular depressions—four near the bow and four near the foot—also decorate the top of the catchplate.   Crossbow fibulae were used in the Roman world from the third through sixth centuries CE (2). The distinctive fasteners, often decorated with prominent onion-shaped knobs, may have been status symbols, as indicated by examples in gold and the famous relief of the fourth-century Roman general Stilicho in Mantua, where crossbow fibulae are clearly rendered on the shoulders of the general and his son (3). Some examples were gilt hollow copper alloy—giving the illusion of the prestigious material without being as expensive or heavy (4).   NOTES:   1. Compare E.

The top of the head is curved and featureless and is completely flat on the back. The facial features are disproportionate to each other: the molded eyes are very large, the nose is smaller, and the mouth is indicated by only a tiny incision. The heart-shaped face has a very small pointed chin on a comparatively large head. The neck is broad and somewhat flattened; there may be some indications of a necklace or collar on the front. The torso is triangular, with very broad, sloping shoulders leading down to a much narrower waist and lower body. The upper arms are pressed to the sides, although separation is indicated by deep gouges on the back and on either side of the forearms on the front. The arms are bent at the elbow, with the palms pressed flat on the collarbone. Incised lines indicate the separation of the long fingers.

The top of the attachment is in the shape of a bowl with objects, mostly spherical and perhaps fruit, in it. The bowl is supported by the tails of two flat creatures, perhaps flatfish (1). The fish-like creatures are piriform; a spur sticks out from the outer side of each near the tail but not on the inner side, making them mirror images of each other.  A ruffled edge is present all around each creature, and both have a small fin on each side of the head. The heads are flat and spade-shaped, with two short antennae or horns at the top and bordered by a band of small dashed lines; the eyes are small circles. The heads are connected with a curving M-shaped bar that has rams’ head terminals, shown in profile but molded in the round.

The alert, somewhat over-sized head with its pricked-up ears is set at a diagonal to the short neck, while the horizontal back leads to a short tail, now broken off. The pronounced, spur-like hocks accentuate the adolescent quality of the legs that splay out to the four corners of the base. Each upper leg is stamped with a circle containing a central point; the two designs on the legs on the left are somewhat more visible than their counterparts on the right. The underside of the partially corroded base is decorated by a small rectangle enclosed by the larger raised rectangle that comprises the edges of the base.    A great many bronze and terracotta figurines of both domestic and wild animals were dedicated in sanctuaries throughout Greece in the Geometric period (2). Domestic animals were the predominant subjects, reflecting their importance in an economy that was based on agriculture and animal husbandry (3). Deer were sacred to Artemis, who both protected and hunted them, and figurines of deer are numerous at her sanctuaries. Images of deer also appear at sanctuaries for other divinities, including Hera, Athena, and Apollo.   NOTES:   1. For “The Boston Deer and Fawn” from the E. P.

311009,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"The bearded head of this furniture fitting is surmounted by a diadem that is possibly part of a striated skullcap or merely surrounds the very stylized hair. The details of the face are executed in an archaistic manner. The large and almond-shaped eyes are deeply drilled and slightly uneven. The nose is large. The molded ears are in proportion to the head. Under the diadem, there are locks of hair at the temples. The facial hair includes a mustache with curled ends and a curled beard falling in two layers of locks; a small, triangular area of chin or another section of the beard is visible under the prominent lower lip. The beard has a clearly arched shape in profile. The square socket of this ornament, which is located behind the head, would likely have covered the end of a wooden beam on a piece of furniture (1).   NOTES:   1. Compare a furniture fitting in the British Museum, London, inv. no. 1967,1017.1 (EA67043); and a chariot socket decoration at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, inv. no. 29.131.3s.     Lisa M.

311010,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This Cretan open-faced helmet was made in two halves that are riveted together at the center; a crest would have been attached along the seam (1). A separate frontlet, perhaps decorated, would have been riveted to the front of the helmet above the eyes; the area it covered has a different color than the rest of the helmet dome (2). Unlike other helmets from this cache now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the dome of this helmet is not decorated, but the flaring neck guard, approximately half of which is preserved, bears two bands of decoration within molding. The upper band consists of two incised rows of hatched triangles with a wide gap between them; the lower band consists of incised egg-and-dart rendered by a double outline. On the proper right, the neck guard decoration terminates in an incised vertical bar with a wave pattern on the interior and a short line of egg-and-dart, rendered similarly to that on the neck guard but perpendicular to it. The proper right cheek piece preserves its original rounded shape and is decorated with an incised eight-petal rosette, each petal rendered with a double line. The proper left cheek piece is much more fragmentary, but a portion of the neck guard decoration can be seen. Above this, the dedicatory inscription “Fισοκράτης τόνδε,” (Fisokrates [took] this), is written in Archaic Cretan letters” (3).    Harvard’s Cretan armor is part of a larger cache, portions of which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg; and the Heraklion Archaeological Museum. Many of the other pieces in the group are highly decorated with incised and repousse images. The objects do not appear to have been part of a dedication to a deity, given the inscriptions found on the pieces. Fourteen pieces of armor from the cache bear dedicatory inscriptions, naming several different warriors, and these seem to indicate that the group of armor was captured in battle and dedicated together as a group (4). It has also been suggested, however, that they perhaps were used for a war dance rather than for combat (5).   Cretan helmets differ from Corinthian helmets by their cheek pieces and lack of nose guard (6). This type of helmet is typically made by joining two sheets of metal, unlike other helmets in the Harvard collection that are raised from one sheet (7), and many will have had a separately made visor, here lost. This is the only helmet in the published group that does not have relief decoration on the skull section (8).   NOTES:   1. For a description of the helmet type as well as a description of the rivets and attachments on this helmet, see H. Hoffmann and A. E. Raubitschek, Early Cretan Armorers (Mainz, 1972) 1-2 and 5, no. H3.   2.

H1, pls. 1-5 and 7.   3. The same inscription occurs on 1991.38. The verb ἧλε (“to take or capture”) appears in inscriptions on other elements of armor from this cache (see 1991.37 and 1991.47) and can therefore be understood here. For a discussion of the inscriptions on Archaic armor and the Afrati cache in particular, see Hoffmann and Raubitschek 1972 (supra 1) 15-16; and G.

The facial features are modeled stylistically: the eyes are small raised ellipses, the nose is triangular, and the mouth is a long gouge. The face is rather flat in profile; the chin is narrow and curved. An elliptical depression on each side of his head may indicate ears. The neck is disproportionately thick and long, leading to a rectangular torso. The figure holds his arms out at chest height. His left arm is missing just below the shoulder; it may have carried a shield (1). There is no indication of musculature on the right arm. The surviving thumb is separate from the rest of the fingers, which are indicated by incision. He holds a dagger pointed downward in his hand. The torso is featureless except for two raised circular nipples and a deep, incised band around the waist that may indicate a belt. The genitals are modeled very simply. The legs are separate down from a point above the knees. They also show no musculature, bending slightly at the knees and tapering at the ankles. The feet are small and featureless. The back of the figure is featureless except for the belt and a groove from the buttocks to the knees to indicate separation of the legs.   Thousands of small, anthropomorphic copper alloy statuettes and anatomical votives have been recovered from remote sanctuary sites in south-central Spain, particularly Collado de los Jardines and Castellar de Santisteban, but it is not certain to which god or gods they were dedicated (2). Many of the statuettes depict individuals, some of whom are represented in poses of prayer or offering (3). Some are very abstract and schematically rendered, while others wear identifiable contemporary clothing (4). In spite of the similarity of the votives, there is nothing to indicate that the intention behind each offering was the same. This example is most likely from the cave sanctuary of Collado de los Jardines near Santa Elena, Jaén.

The helmet is molded around the neck guard but is indicated only by an incised line above the brow. The facial features are disproportionate: the eyes are very large molded ovals, the nose is small, and the mouth is indicated by a tiny incision. The shape of the face is rather square, with the chin jutting out to a point. His neck and body are rather wide, and the body is entirely flat. The shoulders are right angles.

He appears to wear a helmet with no cheek pieces; the neck guard is prominent on the back of the head. His face has large, inset eyes, eyebrows in relief, a prominent nose, and a wide mouth; the chin is narrow and pointed. The neck is round and proportionate. The details of the body are indicated by incision. He wears a long V-neck tunic, perhaps with a mantle over top.

Just below each shoulder, two incised bands indicate either short decorated sleeves on his tunic or arm bands. The long, straight incision on the figure’s right side probably indicates the edge of his open cloak. The hem of his garment is modeled all the way around (flat on the front, rounded on the back).

The head is oval, narrowing toward the chin. She has no neck, and her shoulders are broad. She holds her arms by her sides, joined to the torso. Grooves on the front and back indicate separation.

311024,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This male figure stands frontally, wearing a short tunic and a simple helmet (1). The helmet is close fitting above the brow and does not have cheek pieces, and the neck guard forms a horseshoe shape on the back of the head. His head is rather short and flat compared to that of other examples. His large ears are modeled as flat ovals, and his nose is large and prominent with a deep channel around it. His raised, almond-shaped eyes are narrow, and a long, thin line indicates lips. His neck is wide and flat. He stands with his arms down at his sides, both palms held just in front of his hips. His arms are completely separated from the body from the shoulders to the hands, which are joined to the hip with a deep groove around them to indicate separation; short incised lines indicate fingers. There is no distinction between upper arms and forearms and no indication of musculature. He wears a short tunic with no belt; the V-neck is incised on the front and back and the hem is molded below the hips. His legs and feet are joined; a deep channel is cut on the front and back to indicate the separation of the legs but not the feet. At ankle level on the sides and back, there is a molded ridge that may indicate the hem of trousers.   Thousands of small, anthropomorphic copper alloy statuettes and anatomical votives have been recovered from remote sanctuary sites in south-central Spain, particularly Collado de los Jardines and Castellar de Santisteban, but it is not certain to which god or gods they were dedicated (2). Many of the statuettes depict individuals, some of whom are represented in poses of prayer or offering (3). Some are very abstract and schematically rendered, while others wear identifiable contemporary clothing (4). In spite of the similarity of the votives, there is nothing to indicate that the intention behind each offering was the same. This example is most likely from the cave sanctuary of Collado de los Jardines near Santa Elena, Jaén. It was given to Harvard in 1933 by the Republic of Spain in exchange for the cover of the eleventh-century sarcophagus of Alfonso Ansúrez from Sahagún, León, which was then in the collection of the Fogg Art Museum (5).

The cylindrical neck rises straight from the shoulder into the trefoil mouth. The vessel ends in a ring foot.   The antiquity of this oinochoe is in doubt.

The blade is simple, with a minimal midrib on both sides. The edges are parallel for most of the length, tapering only at the tip to form a point. There is no guard between the blade and hilt, and the edges of the handle are raised, potentially to secure inlay. Three circular perforations in a line on the hilt may indicate where rivets secured inlay. One third of the hilt is the same width as the blade, and then it narrows to the grip before expanding into a mushroom-shaped pommel.

311089,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Portraying a mouflon striding to the right along a groundline, this cheek piece would be intended for the proper right side of a horse’s mouth. Sculpted in the round, the mouflon’s head is turned to face the viewer. This head position is typical of mouflon-shaped cheek pieces and probably serves as a device to display and accommodate the sweeping horns (1). Crowned by high, incised horns arching over tall, erect ears, the mouflon’s face is dominated by round eyes. The neck is enhanced with a dotted and linear pattern. Rendered in relief, the front and back haunches feature border embellishments and a finely incised spoke pattern. The slim, knobby-kneed legs are highly stylized. It has a short tail and a rounded belly. No mate is known for this object, but like the others in the Harvard collection, it is typical of mouflon-shaped cheek pieces attributed to Luristan.   The center of the mouflon’s torso is punctuated by a bit hole (1.6 cm in diameter) that is circumscribed by a ridge. Loops emerge on the top edge of the rear haunch and from behind the head; two conical spikes also project from the concave reverse.    Cheek pieces are components of equestrian gear that were worn on either side of a horse’s mouth (2). They are identified by a central hole through which a bit would have been secured. Cheek straps would have passed through loops at the top, and spikes on the undecorated reverse would have helped control the horse by digging into its cheeks.    Cast zoomorphic cheek pieces may have adorned, protected, and goaded horses. However, it is not clear that this gear was used or if it served specifically as funerary adornment in horse burials, as grave goods in human burials, or as votive objects (3). Although many cheek pieces are attributed to Luristan, no elaborate figural examples come from archaeological contexts (4). Simpler cheek pieces and harness components, however, have been excavated at various first-millennium BCE Iranian sites, including Hasanlu, Giyan, and Sialk (5).    Luristan-style zoomorphic cheek pieces typically feature obverse relief depictions of an animal striding on a groundline facing the direction in which the horse itself would have advanced. Horses, mouflons, and griffins, among other creatures, are represented—variations in imagery may have reflected the identity of the horse or rider, as well as regional and temporal differences.    Because right and left cheek pieces were made from separate molds and no in situ examples have been excavated, it is problematic to attempt to reconstruct matched pairs. Among the abundant figural cheek pieces classified as Luristan are probable forgeries and aftercasts (6).   NOTES:   1. See P. R. S.

311124,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This standing warrior appears to be a copy of one half of a candelabrum group found at Marzabotto, Italy, in the nineteenth century. The features of the face are large and angular, particularly the eyes. The lips are curved upward into an archaic smile. His head is turned slightly downward and to his left. His left arm is missing below the elbow. The right arm is bent slightly, and the hand is at waist level holding a short staff.    The warrior’s helmet is high-crested, and the cheek pieces are raised. The crest bears incised lines, representing feathers or locks of hair, held in place by a curving “comb” decorated with a line of circular impressions. The tail of the crest reaches the center of his back. A circle with a central dot decorates the center of his visor. Locks of wavy hair are visible on the back of his neck.   His breastplate is made up of overlapping scales, indicated by curved incisions. Molded shoulder flaps cover the front and back of his shoulders, ending in curved tabs on the front and rectangular sections on the back. Circles with central dots decorate the front tabs of the shoulder plate; they are the same size as the one on the helmet.  A raised belt separates the scaled portion from a double-row of rectangular pteruges encircling his navel and lower back; the rectangular flaps are decorated with hatchmarks. A short-sleeved cloth tunic is visible under the cuirass at the shoulders and around his groin and buttocks. The warrior’s legs are bare except for greaves, which are indicated with shallow, raised lines. The proper left foot is broken off and missing. A circular-sectioned tang, not of the same casting as the rest of the statuette, is attached to the bottom of his right foot.   The similarity to the Marzabotto candelabrum group was first suggested in print in the 1960s, and it was even proposed that the two might have been made in the same mold (1). There are some differences, particularly in the rendering of the face and of the cuirass. The alloy for the piece has an unusually high zinc content for the Etruscan period. Particularly suspicious is the fact that the Harvard warrior’s arm terminates in the same place where the Marzabotto warrior’s arm connects with the shoulder of the woman. A copy of the female portion of the statue group was known on the art market in the 1960s (2). Although areas of the corrosion on the Harvard object are convincingly ancient, discrepancies have been noted in print prior to the present analysis (3).    The original candelabrum group was retained by the family who originally owned the land where it was found. A scale copy is on display at the Museo Nazionale Etrusco Pompeo Aria, and a colossal copy of the warrior and woman were set up on the grounds of the Villa Aria near the archaeological site. The individual who manufactured the Harvard warrior could have made it using the molds taken from the original that were used to create  the replica on display in the Marzabotto museum, but Harvard’s warrior’s armor in some ways better approximates the armor of the warrior in the colossal group, which is also rendered in curved scales. Another candelabrum finial from Marzabotto, depicting a nude youth carrying an amphora, seems to have been lent to the copiest at the same time as the warrior and woman group, and Harvard owns a copy of this piece as well (1962.62): alloy and lead isotope analysis indicate that 1961.143 and 1962.62 are close relatives, possibly made using copper from the same source (4).

The smaller pendant (1950.138) has a rounded tail and thin legs with feet bending forward. Its head bends downward and is marked by low pellet-shaped eyes. The larger, more abstract bird’s neck and body meet almost at ninety degrees (1960.480). The body thins out into a flattened tail, whose tip is missing. Its legs are simply small stubs, the tips of which are bent forward. Its long neck intersects a pointed head at a ninety-degree angle. One small pellet eye is visible at the back of the right side of the head. Both birds have loops projecting from the middle of their backs. 1950.138 has a perforation in the middle of a projection, and 1960.480 features an oval loop with an oval perforation rising from a tab-like projection.    Both birds are designed in such a way that they balance evenly when suspended. They and many other similar examples, which appear to have included a variety of fowl, both wild and domesticated, may have been hung from the branches of trees as votive gifts in outdoor sanctuaries. They might somehow be related to Artemis, nurturer and protector of the flocks of water birds that throng the rivers, lakes, and marshes of northern Greece.             NOTES:  1. See I.

The youthful, beardless god faces frontally. He wears a diadem with grape leaves and clusters on his wavy hair, which is parted in the center, rolled on the sides, and secured in a bun at the back of the head with a few loose tendrils on the sides of his neck. The face is round and well modeled above a thick neck; the nose is large, the mouth is slightly parted, and the eyes are inlaid with silver, with perforations for the pupils (1). The god wears an animal skin draped over his left shoulder, where the paws are tied in a knot to secure it. The edge of the skin is folded over, and the right side of his chest is bare. The bust ends at shoulder-level with no indication of the arms. The bust is supported by a shallow cup on top of a cylindrical base and circular foot, which is slightly concave on the underside and decorated with concentric circles.   The interior of the bust is hollow, and the top of the head is open. On the back of the head there are two small loops (0.8 cm in diameter), and there is a larger vertical loop (2.1 cm in diameter) on the left side of the head. It is not clear from the object whether there would have been a matching vertical loop on the right side, as discoloration and accretions obscure the area where it would have been, but better-preserved examples indicate that two larger vertical loops were used for suspension of the balsamarium from a handle. The smaller loops on the back of the head would have formed a hinge to secure a lid.   While it has been suggested that bust-shaped containers of this type might have been used to hold oil in the baths, due to issues that would arise in the extraction of oil, it is more likely that they held incense (2). Bust vessels often depicted Africans or Herakles as well as Dionysos (Bacchus) (3).   NOTES:   1.

The round spirals have five turns each. The tip of the pin is missing. Such a small fibula may have belonged to a child.   These fibulae (1952.15, 1952.112, and 1986.516) represent the miniature and monumental ends of the scale of this type of symmetrical fibula, which was commonly termed a “spectacle fibula.” Each was fashioned from a single thin bronze wire, square in section, which was annealed and turned in order to create the symmetrical spiral patterns and the springy elasticity needed to close them. One sharpened end of this wire, forming the pin proper, fits into the other end, which turns up to form a catchplate. Spectacle fibulae were widely distributed throughout the Balkans and northern Greece during the eighth century BCE (1). Excavations of rich burials in the Iron Age tumuli of Vergina and elsewhere have shown that these fibulae occur in pairs, placed over the shoulders of skeletons (2). They also served as dedications in sanctuaries throughout northern and central Greece and the Peloponnesus (3). Thus, they seem to have served to connect the front and back halves of garments at the shoulders of the wearers. It would be interesting to discover whether the presence of pairs of spectacle fibulae in graves is an indicator of female burials, or if both sexes wore two. They also served as dedications.

The neck is short, especially when compared with the long barrel and back and the attenuated legs that are widely planted on the base. On the hind legs, either hocks or fetlocks are lightly indicated approximately three-fourths of the way down the haunches. Hooves are not delineated where the legs meet the base. The right hind leg is cracked through at its midpoint. The tail, now mostly lost, falls from the elevated rump as a thin rod and originally connected with the loop projecting from the rear of the base.   The base is rectangular with rounded corners. It is divided vertically into three parallel rows of openwork triangles with rounded corners: five triangles in the two outer rows, and seven—including the triangle with the projecting loop at the rear—in the center. Sections of the left outer edge of the base are missing. The front legs of the horse are fixed 0.05 cm from the forward edge of the base.   The surface of this piece is pitted and corroded. In 1953, it was cleaned electrolytically to a red-brown patina, but the color has since darkened considerably to a deep chocolate brown.   S. Langdon has dated this horse to 730-710 BCE and attributed it to a Tegean workshop with Argive influence because of the horizontal emphasis of the barrel, the high rump, and the long muzzle (1). This dating and attribution have also been published by J.-L. Zimmermann, who also assigns it to an Arcadian workshop of the late eighth century BCE (2). There are parallels to the base on various bronze votive animal figurines at Olympia, which W.-D. Heilmeyer attributes to a Lakonian workshop (3).        NOTES:   1. S.

311823,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This elongated statuette features a short, narrow waist decorated with a relief girdle from which hang two vertical appendages. The legs are long, especially in the thighs, with the knees articulated as rounded bumps and the feet projecting forward. The legs join in the area above and below the knees. The figure’s arms are bent outward, and the hands fold inward holding an object of uncertain character. The elongated neck is marked by five downward-curving horizontal grooves. The head is an elongated oval form with curving flattened top. On it are rendered a prominent triangular nose, two oval eyes accentuated by incised lines above the brows, a horizontal groove for a mouth, which is emphasized by an upward-curving groove below it, and two tiny perforated areas at the earlobes. This statuette of indeterminate gender differs markedly in style from the products of Levantine workshops making bronze votive statuettes during the Late Bronze Age. It may well be a votive statuette. Reported by the donor to have been bought in Tehran, it is probably of Iranian origin. However, as with all unprovenienced statuettes, close affinities with comparable pieces are difficult to define. While doubts have been expressed in the Technical Observations about its authenticity because of the nature of its surface and corrosion products, a modern manufacture has not been definitively proven. Until this question is settled, it seems advisable to place this statuette roughly in the Iranian Late Bronze or Early Iron Age between c. 1200 and 700 BCE. Stylistically unlike most Luristan bronzes, this piece may be the product of a northwestern Iranian workshop or from a still unknown area.  David G. Mitten",NULL,NULL

There is a prominent projection on the back of the torso at the same level as the arms. There is a ridge in relief around the ankle of the left foot. A raised, curving arc on the torso may represent the diaphragm. A slight bump below this arc may indicate either the naval or the genitalia. The figure’s large head wears a pointed top and is dominated by two prominent eyes that are perforated from front to back. They contain small pieces of another material. They are separated by a beak-like nose under which is a horizontal collar in relief. The pointed top of the head or cap is missing its tip.  The rudimentary nature of this statuette makes it difficult to determine gender or workshop. However, the position of the arms, the pointed head or conical cap, and the presence of what may be male genitalia suggest a god. The prominent eyes, bored completely through the head, indicate a distinctive workshop of similar votive statuettes somewhere in the Levant.  David G. Mitten",NULL,NULL

The right foot has been bent backwards slightly at the ankle. Shallow depressions at the groin outline the genitalia, but it is uncertain whether these are meant to indicate a male or female.  The distinctive modeling of the anatomy and proportions of this statuette clearly identify it as a product of one of the prolific workshops that produced votive bronze statuettes for sanctuaries in the Northern Lebanese city of Byblos in the Late Bronze Age.

The head has a prominent nose, two rounded eyes, and eyebrows in relief that extend sideways from the bridge of the nose. A rounded cap-like projection crowns the head. The back of the head and upper body are flat and featureless. When viewed in profile, sharp ridges, especially on the right side of the torso, suggest that this statuette may have been cast in a bivalve stone mold.

The legs are rounded to a soft point. The left leg and both hands are missing.   The facial features of this type of votive offering have a relatively uniform style: punched roundels for eyes, a raised ridge formed by the angular modeling of the head for a nose, and a simple incised groove for a mouth. Gender can be difficult to determine, as both male and female figures are depicted with nipples; the difference may be that “breasts” tend to be indicated by larger, punched roundels. Genitalia for the females are often an inverted triangle, while for the males there is a nearly circular knob of bronze, although sometimes it is flattened, making identification difficult. These statuettes also have a common stance with arms outstretched to the sides and legs parted in a V-shape. The open positioning of the arms is generally interpreted as a pose of prayer, consistent with that of other types of votive offerings found in tombs and sanctuary deposits (1). The Umbrian examples of this type of votive are cast and file finished; 1,600 of them were found in a pit deposit at a mountain sanctuary at the top of Monte Acuto, Italy (2). A similar sanctuary context for the five figurines in the Harvard collection may also be assumed. Small, lightweight, and flattened in form, they would have been easy to produce and may have been made near cult shrines to catch the trade of visiting pilgrims.   NOTES:   1.

Many of the other pieces in the group are highly decorated with incised and repousse images. The objects do not appear to have been part of a dedication to a deity, given the inscriptions found on the pieces. Fourteen pieces of armor from the cache bear dedicatory inscriptions, naming several different warriors, and these seem to indicate that the group of armor was captured in battle and dedicated together as a group (2). It has also been suggested, however, that they perhaps were used for a war dance rather than for combat (3).     The term “mitra” is known from Homeric literature as a piece of armor worn near the waist; the same word was later used to refer to a type of headwear. No contemporary depictions of warriors show how these semicircular objects were worn (4).

A stylized depiction of musculature is incised in double lines. A curving double line is visible on both sides of the top of the preserved piece outlining the pectoral muscle.   Harvard’s Cretan armor is part of a larger cache, portions of which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg; and the Heraklion Archaeological Museum. Many of the other pieces in the group are highly decorated with incised and repoussé images. The objects do not appear to have been part of a dedication to a deity, given the inscriptions found on the pieces. Fourteen pieces of armor from the cache bear dedicatory inscriptions, naming several different warriors, and these seem to indicate that the group of armor was captured in battle and dedicated together as a group (1). It has also been suggested, however, that they perhaps were used for a war dance rather than for combat (2).   H.

311863,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This bridle or snaffle bit is made of iron; large iron rings are suspended from each end of the jointed mouthpiece. The two mouthpiece sections each have a loop at one end, where they are joined; these loops are followed by a narrower section that expands into a second loop, through which the large rings pass.  The second loops end with a large circular disc on each side to which a thin brass medallion is attached. The brass medallions bear identical scenes showing Bellerophon mounted on Pegasus, riding to the right, with the Chimera below. Bellerophon wears a cloak, flaring out behind him, and grasps a spear in his right hand, which emerges below the legs of Pegasus to stab at the Chimera. Pegasus wears a bridle, with the reins faintly visible; his legs are shown running forward, tail streaming behind him, and his folded wing partially covers the body of Bellerophon. The Chimera is also shown running to the right, his lion-, goat-, and snakeheads all turned to look back at the hero and his mount. The scene is surrounded by a border of dots.   It is not clear if the brass medallions were made specifically to decorate this horse bit or if they were repurposed. The scene on the brass medallions closely resembles copper alloy contorniates of the fourth to early fifth centuries CE, the main difference being the borders (1). Representations even more similar to the Harvard medallions appear on thin, repoussé copper alloy casket covers that have been found particularly in Hungary (2). It is possible that Harvard’s medallions might have come from such a casket cover and were later used to decorate this bridle bit (3).   NOTES:   1.

From the second century CE, the lids frequently bore colored enamel decoration. The Romans used seal boxes to protect the wax or lead seals that they put on documents or other important items prior to transport. When an object was prepared for transport, it would be wrapped in string or twine. The ends of the string would then be put through the seal box, which had a small notch cut into each side to accommodate the string.

312112,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"A single molding appears to have separated the lion mask from the hoop. It is covered with grayish-green patina. In addition, there is a thick layer of iron corrosion on the upper part of the finial, suggesting that it may have been attached to an iron bracelet. Ancient Luristan metalsmiths often combined bronze finials with objects made of iron (1).    The highly stylized lion mask appears to have been the invention of Luristan metal smiths. It is essentially a flattened top view of a feline’s head. Folds of skin surround the eyes like goggles; the nose and upper part of the muzzle are added on one end, and two rounded ears perk up on the other. Such masks appear as finials on bracelets and pins, such as 164.1972, and as junctures on pins with open-cast heads and halberd axes, such as 1943.1318 (2).   Lion-headed bracelets are well known from representations, and some originals survive from the early first millennium BCE. In most cases, the finials are full heads rather than masks, but masks occur on a pair of gold bracelets from a Neo-Assyrian royal burial at Nimrud dated to the second half of the eighth century BCE (3). Closest to the Luristan bracelets is the ornament worn by king Adda-Hamiti-Inshushinak of Elam on a relief fragment from Susa (4). A traditional symbol of power, the lion was often an attribute of the king. The popularity of lion masks on the Luristan bronzes suggests that larger sections of the population used this imagery, although it cannot be excluded that it was reserved for objects intended for dedication to a deity. The relief from Susa indicates that lion-mask bracelets were current in the Elamite realm in the mid-seventh century BCE.    The Harvard fragments are all of different sizes. The smallest head, 1969.177.35.2, also differs stylistically from the others, in that its multiple eyebrows form a continuous line with the nose, separating the face into two halves. This is the more common rendering. The other three finials are modeled very cursorily. The chemical composition suggests that fragments 1969.177.36.A, 1969.177.36.B, and 1969.177.36.C may indeed have come from the same bracelet, even though the seemingly ancient breaks do not match well and the two heads differ in size. Alternatively, they may be fragments from different bracelets, but may have been made from the same batch of metal. The similarity in style and workmanship of the heads leaves little doubt that these were made by the same craftsman (5).   NOTES:   1. See P. R. S.

A portion of the collar remains. It bears stylized volutes and palmettes, incised with double lines, as well as an inscription in Archaic Cretan characters: “[Νέ]ων τόνδ’ ἧλε” (Neon took this) (1). The decorative elements seem to be continued on 1991.40.   Harvard’s Cretan armor is part of a larger cache, portions of which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg; and the Heraklion Archaeological Museum. Many of the other pieces in the group are highly decorated with incised and repoussé images. The objects do not appear to have been part of a dedication to a deity, given the inscriptions found on the pieces. Fourteen pieces of armor from the cache bear dedicatory inscriptions, naming several different warriors, and these seem to indicate that the group of armor was captured in battle and dedicated together as a group (2). It has also been suggested, however, that they perhaps were used for a war dance rather than for combat (3).   H. Hoffman noted that all the breastplates in the Afrati hoard seemed to be a Cretan variant of the bell cuirass that was standard in the Archaic period, which had front and back plates bearing stylized anatomical details (4).

Two parallel spikes are below one wide centered spike, with a deep cleft between the top and bottom prongs. There is some indistinct modeled decoration on top and bottom of the hoops next to the join and on top of the joint.  The underside of joint is slightly concave, more like 1932.56.21 than 1920.44.215.  This bridle trapping has the smallest hoops of the three in the collection, and the prongs are short, comparable to 1920.44.215.   Ringed objects with spikes are relatively common in museum collections, and most tend to come from central Italy, although some are known to have been found in France and Greece (1). They are all very similar in form, and almost all have triangular prongs. It is difficult to determine how these ringed objects were used. They have been interpreted as bow-pullers, equipment for handling the reins of horses or wagons, a type of brass-knuckle, a tool for tooth extraction, protective amulets for horses, or possibly as snaffles on horse-harnesses (2). It is currently generally agreed that they are in some way a part of early European horse equipment.    NOTES:   1. For example, see A.-M.

312242,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"Osiris wears the atef crown without ram’s horns. The sharply modeled facial features contrast with the simplified attention to the rather flat body. The hands are positioned side-by-side; the flail is heavy and pendulous. A crude figure of the goddess Isis in profile facing left appears in raised relief on the back of the statuette. Comparable examples appear in faience statuettes of Osiris, although Isis usually faces right (1). Her arms on either side are positioned in a protective gesture, and wings may be visible flanking the body. The incised line down her torso may represent details of her dress. Her headdress consists of a sun disc with a pair of horns above a modius. Immediately above the headdress of Isis is a small round suspension loop on the back of Osiris' neck. A second loop extends out to the side by his feet on the right. The feet stand on a flat base that forms an obtuse angle with the legs. A broken peg on the underside of the base could have served to secure the figure. The surface has a dark brown patina with scattered pitting, particularly around the chest and back of the head.   Osiris was one of the most popular gods of the Egyptian pantheon. Early in Egyptian history he represented a chthonic fertility god that later acquired the royal insignia of the crook and flail. He came to be identified as the ruler of the underworld. The Egyptian ruler, perceived during his lifetime as the incarnation of Horus, became Osiris after death. Over time, Osiris was equated with all deceased individuals and became a symbol of resurrection. The major cult shrine of Osiris was at Abydos in Middle Egypt, where Seti I (c. 1294-1279 BCE) built a magnificent temple in Dynasty 19.   Small bronze figurines representing Osiris show the god wrapped in a form-fitting garment, perhaps denoting a mummified shroud, and carrying the symbols of rulership—the crook and flail—in each hand. Enveloped in his shroud, Osiris’ arms are bound close to his body and his feet and legs stand together. The god is usually depicted wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt, ornamented with a uraeus (cobra) on the front and sometimes flanked by two feathers (the atef crown). In addition, this crown can rest on a set of spiraling ram’s horns that project to either side.    The bronze figurines take two basic forms: seated or standing. Within each group, several subgroups can be distinguished according to the placement of the hands. The hands can be side-by-side without overlapping, the proper right hand above the left in a vertical alignment, or crossed over one another at the wrists. G. Roeder associates the different poses to geographical areas within Egypt: those with hands side-by-side in Middle Egypt, those with hands one above the other in Lower Egypt, and those with the hands crossed over one another in Upper Egypt (2). The position of the hands also appears to correlate with other broad stylistic features. For example, the ridge created by the shroud pulled around the shoulders occurs primarily on figurines in which the hands are arranged one above the other.   NOTES:   1. J. Baines, pers. comm.

Aubert, eds., Bronzes et or Egyptiens (Paris, 2001) 215, pl. 30, dated to Dynasties 26-30, which has a raised depiction of Isis in profile on the back.

In the inset frame, a lady is seated to the right, spinning, on a backless seat with a cushion and a footstool. The maid facing her holds a mirror in her raised right hand.  Save that this stele appears to belong to the late Hellenistic period rather than firmly in the era of the Roman Empire, the remarks made in connection with and the parallels adduced for the companion stele from the Department of the Classics Collection, described below, could well apply here.  In addition to examples in Leiden (see below), the stele of Phila from the Cook collection at Richmond is a more elaborate, finished version of what we see here (Reinach, 1909-1912, II, p. 532, no. 3; Strong, 1908, pl. 12). The feeling is that, even when the provenance is not known, these stelai carved under Attic influence come from elsewhere on the mainland or the Greek islands, as a group in the National Museum in Athens, form such diverse places as Rhenea next to Delos, Hermione in the Peloponnesus, or the island of Tenos (Reinach, 1909-1912, II, p. 395, nos. 3, 4, and 7).

A man in a himation stands facing, at the left; a woman in a chiton and himation stands next to him. At the extreme right is a small boy in a short tunic and a cloak around his left shoulder. The boy holds a handful of fruits in his cloak with his left hand.  The tombstone belongs to a widespread class of funerary monuments that represents the last manifestations of tradition going back through the big East Greek Hellenistic tomb reliefs to the last Attic stelai of the decade before their traditional curtailment in 317 B.C. Tombstones such as this example were commonly found in the Greek islands (the Aegean), Crete, sometimes North Africa including Egypt, and, above all, the cities along and inland on the western coast of Asia Minor. They also appear in Macedonia and Thrace, but these regions soon changed to a form of monument with busts or just heads in rectangular and circular (tondo) frames.

Similar to other statuettes of young athletes from the late Archaic period, the figure’s head is broad at the temples and his narrow shoulders support a thick neck. Large almond-shaped eyes are set below a low fringe of hair across his forehead. Through the greenish-black patina on the head, traces of vertical incised strokes are visible throughout his hair.   The stance and posture of the young athlete resembles statuettes of javelin and discus throwers that are depicted with fists clenched in preparation for their athletic contests. This young athlete is probably not a javelin thrower, since javelin throwers were typically shown striding forward (1). The Harvard piece more closely resembles statuettes of discus throwers depicted in a standing position bending their elbows to throw a discus (2). The Etruscan craftsmen who made this figurine undoubtedly borrowed elements of Greek sculpture but adapted the figure’s pose according to local tastes. E.

350365,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This is a helmeted head from a small, highly schematic Archaic Umbrian statuette; the piriform shape is a representation of the crest of the helmet. There is a slight taper from the thickness of the neck (2 mm) to the tip of the crest (1 mm). Some small chips are missing from the edge of the crest, including one corner.   When this piece originally came to the Harvard Art Museums, it was attached to the hand of a larger warrior statuette of the same style. The two have since been separated (see 1998.15.14).   Statues and statuettes of warriors in an attacking stance are quite common and range from highly developed—for instance Harvard’s 1977.216.2310—to very abstract, such as the present example (1).

351341,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"One component of this set of belt fastenings has two hooks in the shape of animal, probably horse, heads, while the other has two loops (1). The components interlock when the loops and hooks are connected. An open rectangle, circular in section and flared out at each of the four corners, forms the main portion of each component. The loops, forming large circles, have a short neck attaching them to their rectangle. The hooks are elongated curves ending in stylized horse heads. The horses’ ears are short and round, and the end of their muzzles flare out slightly; additional detail includes an impressed line to indicate mouths and molded and incised lines on the top of the head to indicate manes. The hooks, ending with thin incised horizontal lines and chevrons, connect to an openwork rectangle.   NOTES:   1. Compare J.

352314,Published Catalogue Text,NULL,Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes at the Harvard Art Museums,"This flat, stylized figurine holds its arms out from its sides. Its thin body widens slightly at feet, which are short. It is perhaps a female figure represented in a dress. The notches on the shoulders may be decorative, as is clearly the case in other examples. The back is flat and featureless, curving slightly at the back of the head.  The facial features of this type of votive offering have a relatively uniform style: punched roundels for eyes, a raised ridge formed by the angular modeling of the head for a nose, and a simple incised groove for a mouth. Gender can be difficult to determine, as both male and female figures are depicted with nipples; the difference may be that “breasts” tend to be indicated by larger, punched roundels. Genitalia for the females are often an inverted triangle, while for the males there is a nearly circular knob of bronze, although sometimes it is flattened, making identification difficult. These statuettes also have a common stance with arms outstretched to the sides and legs parted in a V-shape. The open positioning of the arms is generally interpreted as a pose of prayer, consistent with that of other types of votive offerings found in tombs and sanctuary deposits (1). The Umbrian examples of this type of votive are cast and file finished; 1,600 of them were found in a pit deposit at a mountain sanctuary at the top of Monte Acuto, Italy (2). A similar sanctuary context for the five figurines in the Harvard collection may also be assumed. Small, lightweight, and flattened in form, they would have been easy to produce and may have been made near cult shrines to catch the trade of visiting pilgrims.   NOTES:   1.
